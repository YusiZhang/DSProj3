be either murderer or victim, there was no other way . . .
    'It is a pity it broke,' said Hermione quietly, shaking her head.
    'Yeah, it is,' said Ron. 'Still, at least You-Know-Who never found out what was in it either - where are you going?' he added, looking both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up.
    'Er - Hagrid's,' said Harry. 'You know, he just got back and I promised I'd go down and see him and tell him how you two are.'
    'Oh, all right then,' said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond. 'Wish we could come.'
    'Say hello to him for us!' called Hermione, as Harry proceeded down the ward. 'And ask him what's happening about . . . about his little friend!'
    Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory.
    The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday. Everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by revision or homework. Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering out of windows as he went; he could see people messing around in the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake, accompanied by the giant squid.
    He was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not; whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company. He thought he might really go and visit Hagrid, though, as he had not talked to him properly since he'd returned . . .
    Harry had just descended the last marble step into the Entrance Hall when Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room. Harry stopped dead; so did Malfoy and the others. The only sounds were the shouts, laughter and splashes drifting into the Hall from the grounds through the open front doors.
    Malfoy glanced around - Harry knew he was checking for signs of teachers - then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice, 'You're dead, Potter.'
    Harry raised his eyebrows.
    'Funny' he said, 'you'd think I'd have stopped walking around
    Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him; he felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale, pointed face contorted with rage.
    'You're going to pay,' said Malfoy, in a voice barely louder than a whisper. 'I'm going to make you pay for what you've done to my father . . .'
    'Well, I'm terrified now,' said Harry sarcastically. 'I s'pose Lord Voldemort's just a warm-up act compared to you three - what's the matter?' he added, for Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name. 'He's a mate of your dad, isn't he? Not scared of him, are you?'
    'You think you're such a big man, Potter,' said Malfoy, advancing now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him. 'You wait. I'll have you. You can't land my father in prison - '
    'I thought I just had,' said Harry.
    The Dementors have left Azkaban,' said Malfoy quietly. 'Dad and the others'll be out in no time . . .'
    'Yeah, I expect they will,' said Harry. 'Still, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now - '
    Malfoy's hand flew towards his wand, but Harry was too quick for him; he had drawn his own wand before Malfoy's fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes.
    'Potter!'
    The voice rang across the Entrance Hall. Snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him Harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt towards Malfoy . . . whatever Dumbledore said, he would never forgive Snape . .  . never . . .
    'What are you doing, Potter?' said Snape, as coldly as ever, as he strode over to the four of them.
    'I'm trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,' said Harry fiercely.
    Snape stared at him.
    'Put that wand away at once,' he said curtly. Ten points from Gryff - '
    Snape looked towards the giant hour-glasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile.
    'Ah. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hour-glass to take away. In that case, Potter, we will simply have to - '
    'Add some more?'
    Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone, steps into the castle; she was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other, but otherwise looked quite well.
    'Professor McGonagall!' said Snape, striding forwards. 'Out of St Mungo's, I see!'
    'Yes, Professor Snape,' said Professor McGonagall. shrugging off her travelling cloak, 'I'm quite as good as new. You two - Crabbe - Goyle - '
    She beckoned them forwards imperiously and they came, shuffling their large feet and looking awkward.
    'Here,' said Professor McGonagall, thrusting her carpetbag into Crabbe's chest and her cloak into Goyle's, 'take these up to my office for me.'
    They turned and stumped away up the marble staircase.
    'Right then,' said Professor McGonagall, looking up at the hourglasses on the wall. 'Well, I think Potter and his friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You-Know-Who! What say you, Professor Snape?'
    'What?' snapped Snape, though Harry knew he had heard perfectly well. 'Oh - well - I suppose . . .'
    'So that's fifty each for Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom and Miss Granger,' said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor s hour-glass as she spoke. 'Oh - and fifty for Miss Lovegood, I suppose,' she added, and a number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaw's glass. 'Now, you wanted to take ten from Mr Potter, I think, Professor Snape - so there we are . . .'
    A few rubies retreated into the upper bulb, leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless.
    'Well, Potter, Malfoy, I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this,' Professor McGonagall continued briskly.
    Harry did not need telling twice; he thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at Snape and Malfoy.
    The hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns towards Hagrid's cabin. Students lying around on the grass sunbathing, talking, reading the Sunday Prophet and eating sweets, looked up at him as he passed; some called out to him, or else waved, clearly eager to show that they, like the Prophet, had decided he was something of a hero. Harry said nothing to any of them. He had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago, but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred to keep it that way.
    He thought at first when he knocked on Hagrid's cabin door that he was out, but then Fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome. Hagrid, it transpired, was picking runner beans in his back garden.
    'All righ', Harry!' he said, beaming, when Harry approached the fence. 'Come in, come in, we'll have a cup o' dandelion juice . . .
    'How's things?' Hagrid asked him, as they settled down at his wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice. 'Yeh - er - feelin' all righ', are yeh?'
    Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrid's face that he was not referring to Harry's physical well-being.
    'I'm fine,' Harry said quickly, because he could not bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in Hagrid's mind. 'So, where've you been?'
    'Bin hidin' out in the mountains,' said Hagrid. 'Up in a cave, like Sirius did when he - '
    Hagrid broke off, cleared his throat gruffly, looked at Harry, and took a long draught of juice.
    'Anyway, back now,' he said feebly.
    'You - you look better,' said Harry, who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from Sirius.
    'Wha?' said Hagrid, raising a massive hand and feeling his face. 'Oh - oh yeah. Well, Grawpy's loads better behaved now, loads. Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back, ter tell yeh the truth. He's a good lad, really . . . Ive bin thmkin abou tryin ter find him a lady friend, actually . . .'
    Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this idea at once; the prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the Forest, possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp, was positively alarming, but somehow Harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point. He was starting to wish he was alone again, and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice, half-emptying bis glass.
    'Ev'ryone knows yeh've bin tellin' the truth now, Harry' said Hagrid softly and unexpectedly. He was watching Harry closely. Tha's gotta be better, hasn' it?'
    Harry shrugged.
    'Look . . .' Hagrid leaned towards him across the table, 'I knew Sirius longer 'n yeh did . . . he died in battle, an tha's the way he'd've wanted ter go - '
    'He didn't want to go at all!' said Harry angrily.
    Hagrid bowed his great shaggy head.
    'Nah, I don' reckon he did,' he said quietly. 'But still, Harry . . . he was never one ter sit aroun' at home an' let other people do the fightin'. He couldn've lived with himself if he hadn' gone ter help - '
    Harry leapt up.
    'I've got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing,' he said mechanically.
    'Oh,' said Hagrid, looking rather upset. 'Oh . . . all righ' then, Harry . . . take care o' yerself then, an' drop back in if yeh've got a mo . . .'
    'Yeah . . . right
    Harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open; he was out in the sunshine again before Hagrid had finished saying goodbye, and walking away across the lawn. Once again, people called out to him as he passed. He closed his eyes for a few moments, wishing they would all vanish, that he could open his eyes and find himself alone in the grounds . . .
    A few days ago, before his exams had finished and he had seen the vision Voldemort had planted in his mind, he would have given almost anything for the wizarding world to know he had been telling the truth, for them to believe that Voldemort was back, and to know that he was neither a liar nor mad. Now, however . . .
    He walked a short way around the lake, sat down on its bank, sheltered from the gaze of passers-by behind a tangle of shrubs, and stared out over the gleaming water, thinking . . .
    Perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt isolated from everybody since his talk with Dumbledore. An invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world. He was - he had always been - a marked man. It was just that he had never really understood what that meant . . .
    And yet sitting here on the edge of the lake, with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him, with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside, he could not muster any great sense of fear. It was sunny, and the grounds around him were full of laughing people, and even though he felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race, it was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include, or end in, murder . . .
    He sat there for a long time, gazing out at the water, trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here, on the opposite bank, that Sirius had once collapsed trying to fend off a hundred Dementors . . .
    The sun had set before he realised he was cold. He got up and returned to the castle, wiping his face on his sleeve as he went.
*
Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term. Hermione kept showing signs of wanting to talk about Sirius, but Ron tended to make 'hushing' noises every time she mentioned his name. Harry was still not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet; his wishes varied with his mood. He knew one thing, though: unhappy as he felt at the moment, he would greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days' time when he was back at number four, Privet Drive. Even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer, he did not feel any better about it. Indeed, he had never dreaded his return more.
    Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term. It seemed she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for her, she met Peeves on the way, who seized his last chance to do as Fred had instructed, and chased her gleefully from the premises whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk. Many students ran out into the Entrance Hall to watch her running away down the path and the Heads of Houses tried only half-heartedly to restrain them. Indeed, Professor McGonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after Umbridge herself, because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick.
    Their last evening at school arrived; most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the end-of-term leaving feast, but Harry had not even started.
    'Just do it tomorrow!' said Ron, who was waiting by the door of their dormitory. 'Come on, I'm starving.'
    'I won't be long . . . look, you go ahead . . ."
    But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron, Harry made no effort to speed up his packing. The very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the Leaving Feast. He was worried that Dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech. He was sure to mention Voldemort's return; he had talked to them about it last year, after all . . .
    Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and, as he did so, noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it. He could not think what it was doing there. He bent down, pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it.
    He realised what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve Grimmauld Place. 'Use it if you need me, all right?'
    Harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small, square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him.
    He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note from Sirius.
This is a two-way mirror, I've got the other one of the pair. If you need to speak to me, just say my name into it; you'll appear in my mirror and I'll be able to talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate detentions.
Harry's heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius again, right now, he knew it - '
    He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said, loudly and clearly, 'Sirius.'
    His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own.
    He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly through the room:
    'Sirius Black!'
    Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still, definitely, his own . . .
    Sirius didn't have his mirror on him when he went through the archway, said a small voice in Harry's head. That's why it's riot working . . .
    Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered. He had been convinced, for a whole, shining minute, that he was going to see Sirius, talk to him again . . .
    Disappointment was burning in his throat; he got up and began throwing his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror - '
    But then an idea struck him . . . a better idea than a mirror . . . a much bigger, more important idea . . . how had he never thought of it before - why had he never asked?
    He was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase, hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing; he hurtled across the empty common room, through the portrait hole and off along the corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after him: The feast is about to start, you know, you're cutting it very fine!'
    But Harry had no intention of going to the feast . . .
    How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you didn't need one, yet now . . .
    He ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead. They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall. Outside his Charms classroom he came to a halt, panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later, until after the end of the feast . . .
    But just as he had given up hope, he saw it - a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor.
    'Hey - hey, Nick! NICK!'
    The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall, revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington.
    'Good evening,' he said, withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at Harry. 'I am not the only one who is late, then? Though,' he sighed, 'in a rather different sense, of course . . .'
    'Nick, can I ask you something?'
    A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick's face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter, apparently to give himself thinking time. He desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely.
    'Er - now, Harry?' said Nick, looking discomfited. 'Can't it wait until after the feast?'
    'No - Nick - please,' said Harry, 'I really need to talk to you. Can we go in here?'
    Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed.
    'Oh, very well,' he said, looking resigned. 'I can't pretend I haven't been expecting it.'
    Harry was holding the door open for him, but he drifted through the wall instead.
    'Expecting what?' Harry asked, as he closed the door.
    'You to come and find me,' said Nick, now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds. 'It happens, sometimes . . . when somebody has suffered a . . . loss.'
    'Well,' said Harry, refusing to be deflected. 'You were right, I've - I've come to find you.'
    Nick said nothing.
    'It's - ' said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated, 'it's just - you're dead. But you're still here, aren't you?'
    Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds.
    That's right, isn't it?' Harry urged him. 'You died, but I'm talking to you . . . you can walk around Hogwarts and everything, can't you?'
    'Yes,' said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, 'I walk and talk, yes.'
    'So, you came back, didn't you?' said Harry urgently. 'People can come back, right? As ghosts. They don't have to disappear completely. Well?' he added impatiently, when Nick continued to say nothing.
    Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, 'Not everyone can come back as a ghost.'
    'What d'you mean?' said Harry quickly.
    'Only . . . only wizards.'
    'Oh,' said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief. 'Well, that's OK then, the person I'm asking about is a wizard. So he can come back, right?'
    Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry.
    'He won't come back.'
    Who?'
    'Sirius Black,' said Nick.
    'But you did!' said Harry angrily. 'You came back - you're dead and you didn't disappear - '
    'Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod,' said Nick miserably. 'But very few wizards choose that path.'
    'Why not?' said Harry. 'Anyway - it doesn't matter - Sirius won't care if it's unusual, he'll come back, I know he will!'
    And so strong was his belief, Harry actually turned his head to check the door, sure, for a split second, that he was going to see Sirius, pearly-white and transparent but beaming, walking through it towards him.
    'He will not come back,' repeated Nick. 'He will have . . . gone on.'
    'What d'you mean, "gone on"?' said Harry quickly. 'Gone on where? Listen - what happens when you die, anyway? Where do you go? Why doesn't everyone come back? Why isn't this place full of ghosts? Why - ?'
    'I cannot answer,' said Nick.
    'You're dead, aren't you?' said Harry exasperatedly. 'Who can answer better than you?'
    'I was afraid of death,' said Nick softly. 'I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't to have . . . well, that is neither here nor there . . . in fact, I am neither here nor there . . .' He gave a small sad chuckle. 'I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead. I believe learned wizards study the matter in the Department of Mysteries - '
    'Don't talk to me about that place!' said Harry fiercely.
    'I am sorry not to have been more help,' said Nick gently. 'Well . . . well, do excuse me . . . the feast, you know . . .'
    And he left the room, leaving Harry there alone, gazing blankly at the wall through which Nick had disappeared.
    Harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once more. He walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle, wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again.
    He had turned the corner towards the Fat Lady's corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall. A second glance showed him it was Luna. There were no good hiding places nearby, she was bound to have heard his footsteps, and in any case, Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment.
    'Hello,' said Luna vaguely, glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice.
    'How come you're not at the feast?' Harry asked.
    'Well, I've lost most of my possessions,' said Luna serenely. 'People take them and hide them, you know. But as it's the last night, I really do need them back, so I've been putting up signs.'
    She gestured towards the noticeboard, upon which, sure enough, she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes, with a plea for their return.
    An odd feeling rose in Harry; an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since Sirius's death. It was a few moments before he realised that he was feeling sorry for Luna.
    'How come people hide your stuff?' he asked her, frowning.
    'Oh . . . well . . .' she shrugged. 'I think they think I'm a bit odd, you know. Some people call me "Loony" Lovegood, actually.'
    Harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully.
    That's no reason for them to take your things,' he said flatly. 'D'you want help finding them?'
    'Oh, no,' she said, smiling at him. They'll come back, they always do in the end. It was just that I wanted to pack tonight. Anyway . . . why aren't you at the feast?'
    Harry shrugged. 'Just didn't feel like it.'
    'No,' said Luna, observing him with those oddly misty, protuberant eyes. 'I don't suppose you do. That man the Death Eaters killed was your godfather, wasn't he? Ginny told me.'
    Harry nodded curtly, but found that for some reason he did not mind Luna talking about Sirius. He had just remembered that she, too, could see Thestrals.
    'Have you . . .' he began. 'I mean, who . . . has anyone you known ever died?'
    'Yes,' said Luna simply, 'my mother. She was a quite extraordinary witch, you know, but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day. I was nine.'
    'I'm sorry,' Harry mumbled.
    'Yes, it was rather horrible,' said Luna conversationally. 'I still feel very sad about it sometimes. But I've still got Dad. And anyway, it's not as though I'll never see Mum again, is it?'
    'Er - isn't it?' said Harry uncertainly.
    She shook her head in disbelief.
    'Oh, come on. You heard them, just behind the veil, didn't you?'
    'You mean . . .'
    'In that room with the archway. They were just lurking out of sight, that's all. You heard them.'
    They looked at each other. Luna was smiling slightly. Harry did not know what to say, or to think; Luna believed so many extraordinary things . . . yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil, too.
    'Are you sure you don't want me to help you look for your stuff?' he said.
    'Oh, no,' said Luna. 'No, I think I'll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up . . . it always does in the end . . . well, have a nice holiday, Harry.'
    'Yeah . . . yeah, you too.'
    She walked away from him and, as he watched her go, he found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly.
*
The journey home on the Hogwarts Express next day was eventful in several ways. Firstly, Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle, who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses, attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as he made his way back from the toilet. The attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of DA members, who saw what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to Harry's aid. By the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein and Terry Boot, had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had taught them, Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniform as Harry, Ernie and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze.
    'I must say, I'm looking forward to seeing Malfoy's mothers face when he gets off the train,' said Ernie, with some satisfaction, as
    he watched Malfoy squirm above him. Ernie had never quite got over the indignity of Malfoy docking points from Hufflepuff during his brief spell as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad.
    'Goyle's mum'll be really pleased, though,' said Ron, who had come to investigate the source of the commotion. 'He's loads better-looking now . . . anyway, Harry, the food trolley's just stopped if you want anything . . .'
    Harry thanked the others and accompanied Ron back to their compartment, where he bought a large pile of cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties. Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet again, Ginny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler and Neville was stroking his Mimbulus mimbletonia, which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched.
    Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while Hermione read out snippets from the Prophet. It was now full of articles about how to repel Dementors, attempts by the Ministry to track down Death Eaters and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning . . .
    'It hasn't really started yet,' sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up the newspaper again. 'But it won't be long now
    'Hey, Harry,' said Ron softly, nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor.
    Harry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho's eyes met for a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Ron's knight.
    'What's - er - going on with you and her, anyway?' Ron asked quietly.
    'Nothing,' said Harry truthfully.
    'I - er - heard she's going out with someone else now,' said Hermione tentatively.
    Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all. Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him; so much of what he had wanted before Sirius's death felt that way these days . . . the week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer; it stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in it, and the one without.
    'You're well out of it, mate,' said Ron forcefully. 'I mean, she's quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more cheerful.'
    'She's probably cheerful enough with someone else,' said Harry, shrugging.
    'Who's she with now, anyway?' Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered.
    'Michael Corner,' she said.
    'Michael - but - ' said Ron, craning around in his seat to state at her. 'But you were going out with him!'
    'Not any more,' said Ginny resolutely. 'He didn't like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch, and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.' She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill, turned The Quibbler upside-down and began marking her answers. Ron looked highly delighted.
    'Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,' he said, prodding his queen forwards towards Harry's quivering castle. 'Good for you. Just choose someone - better - next time.
    He cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it.
    'Well, I've chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he's better?' asked Ginny vaguely.
    'WHAT?' shouted Ron, upending the chessboard: Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead.
    As the train slowed down in the approach to King's Cross, Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less. He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take him back to Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill, however, he lifted down Hedwig's cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual.
    When the ticket inspector signalled to Harry, Ron and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet him who he had not expected at all.
    There was Mad-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it, his gnarled hands clutching a long staff, his body wrapped in a voluminous travelling cloak. Tonks stood just behind him, her bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend The Weird Sisters. Next to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair greying, a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers. At the front of the group stood Mr and Mrs Weasley, dressed in their Muggle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new jackets in some lurid green, scaly material.
    'Ron, Ginny!' called Mrs Weasley, hurrying forwards and hugging her children tightly. 'Oh, and Harry dear - how are you?'
    'Fine,' lied Harry, as she pulled him into a tight embrace. Over her shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins' new clothes.
    'What are they supposed to be?' he asked, pointing at the jackets.
    'Finest dragonskin, little bro',' said Fred, giving his zip a little tweak. 'Business is booming and we thought we'd treat ourselves.'
    'Hello, Harry,' said Lupin, as Mrs Weasley let go of Harry and turned to greet Hermione.
    'Hi,' said Harry. 'I didn't expect . . . what are you all doing here?'
    'Well,' said Lupin with a slight smile, 'we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home.'
    'I dunno if that's a good idea,' said Harry at once.
    'Oh, I think it is,' growled Moody, who had limped a little closer. That'll be them, will it, Potter?'
    He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder; his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat. Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was pointing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked positively appalled to see Harry's reception committee.
    'Ah, Harry!' said Mr Weasley, turning from Hermione's parents, who he had just greeted enthusiastically, and who were now taking it in turns to hug Hermione. 'Well - shall we do it, then?'
    'Yeah, I reckon so, Arthur,' said Moody.
    He and Mr Weasley took the lead across the station towards the Dursleys, who were apparently rooted to the floor. Hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the group.
    'Good afternoon,' said Mr Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon as he came to a halt right in front of him. 'You might remember me, my name's Arthur Weasley.'
    As Mr Weasley had single-handedly demolished most of the Dursleys' living room two years previously, Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him. Sure enough, Uncle Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr Weasley, but chose not to say anything, partly, perhaps, because the Dursleys were outnumbered two to one. Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed; she kept glancing around, &s though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company. Dudley, meanwhile, seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant, a feat at which he was failing extravagantly.
    'We thought we'd just have a few words with you about Harry,' said Mr Weasley, still smiling.
    'Yeah,' growled Moody. 'About how he's treated when he's at your place.'
    Uncle Vernon's moustache seemed to bristle with indignation. Possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he was dealing with a kindred spirit, he addressed himself to Moody.
    'I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house - '
    'I expect what you're not aware of would fill several books, Dursley,' growled Moody.
    'Anyway, that's not the point,' interjected Tonks, whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for she closed her eyes rather than look at her. 'The point is, if we find out you've been horrible to Harry - '
    - And make no mistake, we'll hear about it,' added Lupin pleasantly.
    'Yes,' said Mr Weasley, 'even if you won't let Harry use the felly-tone -
    'Telephone,' whispered Hermione.
    - Yeah, if we get any hint that Potter's been mistreated in any way, you'll have us to answer to,' said Moody.
    Uncle Vernon swelled ominously. His sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs.
    'Are you threatening me, sir?' he said, so loudly that passers-by actually turned to stare.
    'Yes, I am,' said Mad-Eye, who seemed rather pleased that Uncle Vernon had grasped this fact so quickly.
    'And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated?' barked Uncle Vernon.
    'Well . . .' said Moody, pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye. Uncle Vernon leapt backwards in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley. 'Yes, I'd have to say you do, Dursley.'
    He turned away from Uncle Vernon to survey Harry.
    'So, Potter . . . give us a shout if you need us. If we don't hear from you for three days in a row, we'll send someone along . . .'
    Aunt Petunia whimpered piteously. It could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbours would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path.
    'Bye, then, Potter,' said Moody, grasping Harry's shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand.
    'Take care, Harry,' said Lupin quietly. 'Keep in touch.'
    'Harry, we'll have you away from there as soon as we can,' Mrs Weasley whispered, hugging him again.
    'We'll see you soon, mate,' said Ron anxiously, shaking Harry's hand.
    'Really soon, Harry,' said Hermione earnestly. 'We promise.
    Harry nodded. He somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him, to see them all ranged there, on his side. Instead, he smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around and led the way out of the station towards the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Dudley hurrying along in his wake.

Chapter 1: The Other Minister

It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. He was waiting for a call from the President of a far distant country, and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and difficult week, there was not much space in his head for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to explain why each and every one of them was the government's fault. 
The Prime Minister's pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations, for they were neither fair nor true. How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property? And was it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family?
"A grim mood has gripped the country," the opponent had concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin.
And unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister felt it himself; people really did seem more miserable than usual. Even the weather was dismal; all this chilly mist in the middle of July... It wasn't right, it wasn't normal...
He turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job. Stretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully. It was a handsome room, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window, looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass. It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he heard a soft cough behind him.
He froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking reflection in the dark glass. He knew that cough. He had heard it before. He turned very slowly to face the empty room. 
"Hello?" he said, trying to sound braver than he felt.
For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him. However, a voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement. It was coming -- as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough -- from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room.
"To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge."
The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister.
"Er," said the Prime Minister, "listen... Its not a very good time for me... I'm waiting for a telephone call, you see... from the President of--"
"That can be rearranged," said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister's heart sank. He had been afraid of that.
"But I really was rather hoping to speak--"
"We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead," said the little man. "Kindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge."

"I... oh ... very well," said the Prime Minister weakly. "Yes, I'll see Fudge."
He hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as he went. He had barely resumed his seat, and arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand.
"Ah... Prime Minister," said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward with his hand outstretched. "Good to see you again."
The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment, so said nothing at all. He was not remotely pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional appearances, apart from being downright alarming in themselves, generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was looking distinctly careworn. He was thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before, and it never boded well.
"How can I help you?" he said, shaking Fudge's hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk.
"Difficult to know where to begin," muttered Fudge, pulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing his green bowler upon his knees. "What a week, what a week..."
"Had a bad one too, have you?" asked the Prime Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Fudge.
"Yes, of course," said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minister. "I've been having the same week you have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale Bridge... the Bones and Vance murders... not to mention the ruckus in the West Country..."
"You--er--your--I mean to say, some of your people were--were involved in those--those things, were they?"
Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. "Of course they were," he said, "Surely you've realized what's going on?"
"I..." hesitated the Prime Minister.
It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike Fudge's visits so much. He was, after all, the Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day.
He had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself
Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad. He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained speechless throughout Fudge's kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and prevented the non-magical population from getting wind of them. It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point). Fudge had then patted the shoulder of the sLill-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way.
"Not to worry," he had said, "it's odds-on you'll never see me again. I'll only bother you if there's something really serious going on our end, something that's likely to affect the Muggles--the non-magical population, I should say. Otherwise, it's live and let live. And I must say, you're taking it a lot better than your predecessor. He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition."
At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. "You're--you're not a hoax, then?"
It had been his last, desperate hope.
"No," said Fudge gently. "No, I'm afraid I'm not. Look."
And he had turned the Prime Minister's teacup into a gerbil.
"But," said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, "but why--why has nobody told me--?"
"The Minister of Magic only reveals him--or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day," said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket. "We find it the best way to maintain secrecy."
"But then," bleated the Prime Minister, "why hasn't a former Prime Minister warned me--?"
At this, Fudge had actually laughed.
"My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?"
Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?
The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced Fudge's arrival. To the Prime Minister's dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossible to remove. When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office. Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened.
Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never heard of, a man named "Serious" Black, something that sounded like "Hogwarts," and a boy called Harry Potter, none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister.
"...I've just come from Azkaban," Fudge had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket. "Middle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight... the dementors are in uproar"--he shuddered--"they've never had a breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister. Black's a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You-Know-Who.... But of course, you don't even know who You-Know-Who is!" He had gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment, then said, "Well, sit down, sit down, I'd better fill you in... Have a whiskey..."
The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his own whiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Minister's hand, and drew up a chair.
Fudge had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister's whiskey-free hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too.
"So you think that..." He had squinted down at the name in his left hand. "Lord Vol--"
"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!" snarled Fudge.
"I'm sorry... You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is still alive, then?"
"Well, Dumbledore says he is," said Fudge, as he had fastened his pin-striped cloak under his chin, "but we've never found him. If you ask me, he's not dangerous unless he's got support, so it's Black we ought to be worrying about. You'll put out that warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don't see each other again, Prime Minister! Good night."
But they had seen each other again. Less than a year later a harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) World Cup and that several Muggles had been "involved," but that the Prime Minister was not to worry, the fact that You-Know-Who's Mark had been seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke.
"Oh, and I almost forgot," Fudge had added. "We're importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tells me that its down in the rule book that we have to notify you if we're bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country."
"I--what--dragons?" spluttered the Prime Minister.
"Yes, three," said Fudge. "And a sphinx. Well, good day to you."
The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but no. Less than two years later, Fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban.
"A mass breakout?" repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.
"No need to worry, no need to worry!" shouted Fudge, already with one foot in the flames. "We'll have them rounded up in no time--just thought you ought to know!"
And before the Prime Minister could shout, "Now, wait just one moment!" Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks.
Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not escaped his notice that, despite Fudge's assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit. Little though he liked to think about the Minister of Magic (or, as he always called Fudge in his head, the Other Minister), the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news still. The site, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not know exactly why he was there, was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week.
"How should I know what's going on in the--er--Wizarding community?" snapped the Prime Minister now. "I have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without--"
"We have the same concerns," Fudge interrupted. "The Brock-dale Bridge didn't wear out. That wasn't really a hurricane. Those murders were not the work of Muggles. And Herbert Chorley's family would be safer without him. We are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move should be effected tonight."
"What do you... I'm afraid I ... What?" blustered the Prime Minister.
Fudge took a great, deep breath and said, "Prime Minister, I am very sorry to have to tell you that he's back. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back."
"Back? When you say 'back'... he's alive? I mean--"
The Prime Minister groped in his memory for the details of that horrible conversation of three years previously, when Fudge had told him about the wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier.
"Yes, alive," said Fudge. "That is--I don't know--is a man alive if he can't be killed? I don't really understand it, and Dumbledore won't explain properly--but anyway, he's certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the purposes of our discussion, yes, he's alive."
The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well-informed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations.
"Is Serious Black with--er--He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?"
"Black? Black?" said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers. "Sirius Black, you mean? Merlin's beard, no. Black's dead. Turns out we were--er--mistaken about Black. He was innocent after all. And he wasn't in league with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named either. I mean," he added defensively, spinning the bowler hat still faster, "all the evidence pointed--we had more than fifty eyewitnesses--but anyway, as I say, he's dead. Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. There's going to be an inquiry, actually..."
To his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however, eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under his charge... Not yet, anyway...
While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk, Fudge continued, "But Blacks by-the-by now. The point is, we're at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken."
"At war?" repeated the Prime Minister nervously. "Surely that's a little bit of an overstatement?"
"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January," said Fudge, speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a lime-green blur. "Since they have moved into the open, they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale Bridge--he did it, Prime Minister, he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and--"
"Good grief, so it's your fault those people were killed and I'm having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I don't know what else!" said the Prime Minister furiously.
"My fault!" said Fudge, coloring up. "Are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that?"
"Maybe not," said the Prime Minister, standing up and striding about the room, "but I would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity!"
"Do you really think I wasn't already making every effort?" demanded Fudge heatedly. "Every Auror in the Ministry was--and is--trying to find him and round up his followers, but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades!"
"So I suppose you're going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too?" said the Prime Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, almost worse than it being the government's fault after all.
"That was no hurricane," said Fudge miserably.
"Excuse me!" barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up and down. "Trees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries--"
"It was the Death Eaters," said Fudge. "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's followers. And... and we suspect giant involvement."
The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall. "What involvement?"
Fudge grimaced. "He used giants last time, when he wanted to go for the grand effect," he said. "The Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock, we've had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened, we've got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset, but we can't find the giant--it's been a disaster."
"You don't say!" said the Prime Minister furiously.
"I won't deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry," said Fudge. "What with all that, and then losing Amelia Bones."
"Losing who?"
"Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. We think He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may have murdered her in person, because she was a very gifted witch and--and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight."
Fudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it seemed, stopped spinning his bowler hat.
"But that murder was in the newspapers," said the Prime Minister, momentarily diverted from his anger. "Our newspapers. Amelia Bones... it just said she was a middle-aged woman who lived alone. It was a--a nasty killing, wasn't it? It's had rather a lot of publicity. The police are baffled, you see."
Fudge sighed. "Well, of course they are," he said. "Killed in a room that was locked from the inside, wasn't she? We, on the other hand, know exactly who did it, not that that gets us any further toward catching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, maybe you didn't hear about that one--"
"Oh yes I did!" said the Prime Minister. "It happened just around the corner from here, as a matter of fact. The papers had a field day with it, 'breakdown of law and order in the Prime Minister's backyard--'"
"And as if all that wasn't enough," said Fudge, barely listening to the Prime Minister, "we've got dementors swarming all over the place, attacking people left, right, and center..."
Once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the Prime Minister, but he was wiser now.
"I thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban," he said cautiously.
"They did," said Fudge wearily. "But not anymore. They've deserted the prison and joined He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I won't pretend that wasn't a blow."
"But," said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror, "didn't you tell me they're the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?"
"That's right. And they're breeding. That's what's causing all this mist."
The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the nearest chair. The idea of invisible creatures swooping through the towns and countryside, spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel quite faint.
"Now see here, Fudge--you've got to do something! It's your responsibility as Minister of Magic!"
"My dear Prime Minister, you can't honestly think I'm still Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I've never known them so united in my whole term of office!" said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile.
The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. Despite his indignation at the position into which he had been placed, he still rather felt for the shrunken-looking man sitting opposite him.
"I'm very sorry," he said finally. "If there's anything I can do?"
"It's very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing. I was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor. I rather thought he'd be here by now, but of course, he's very busy at the moment, with so much going on."
Fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig, who was digging in his ear with the point of a quill. Catching Fudge's eye, the portrait said, "He'll be here in a moment, he's just finishing a letter to Dumbledore."
"I wish him luck," said Fudge, sounding bitter for the first time. "I've been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight, but he won't budge. If he'd just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still be... Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more success."
Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence, but it was broken almost immediately by the portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official voice.
"To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a meeting. Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic."
"Yes, yes, fine," said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug.
Fudge got to his feet and, after a moment's hesitation, the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, and look around.
The Prime Minister's first, foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister thought he understood why the Wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous times.
"How do you do?" said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.
Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled out a wand from under his robes.
"Fudge told you everything?" he asked, striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock click.
"Er--yes," said the Prime Minister. "And if you don't mind, I'd rather that door remained unlocked."
"I'd rather not be interrupted," said Scrimgeour shortly, "or watched," he added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across them. "Right, well, I'm a busy man, so let's get down lo business. First of all, we need to discuss your security."
The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied, "I am perfectly happy with the security I've already got, thank you very--"
"Well, we're not," Scrimgeour cut in. "It'll be a poor lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new secretary in your outer office--"
"I'm not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that's what you're suggesting!" said the Prime Minister hotly. "He's highly efficient, gets through twice the work the rest of them--"
"That's because he's a wizard," said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a smile. "A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your protection."
"Now, wait a moment!" declared the Prime Minister. "You can't just put your people into my office, I decide who works for me--"
"I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?" said Scrimgeour coldly.
"I am--that's to say, I was--"
"Then there's no problem, is there?" said Scrimgeour.
"I... well, as long as Shacklebolt's work continues to be... er... excellent," said the Prime Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him.
"Now, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister," he continued. "The one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck."
"What about him?" asked the Prime Minister.
"He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse," said Scrimgeour. "It's addled his brains, but he could still be dangerous."
"He's only quacking!" said the Prime Minister weakly. "Surely a bit of a rest... Maybe go easy on the drink..."
"A team of Healers from St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of them," said Scrimgeour. "I think it best that we remove him from Muggle society for a while."
"I... well... He'll be all right, won't he?" said the Prime Minister anxiously.
Scrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back toward the fireplace.
"Well, that's really all I had to say. I will keep you posted of developments, Prime Minister--or, at least, I shall probably be too busy to come personally, in which case I shall send Fudge here. He has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity."
Fudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he merely looked as though he had a toothache. Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire green. The Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment, then the words he had fought to suppress all evening burst from him at last.
"But for heaven's sake--you're wizards! You can do magic! Surely you can sort out--well--anything!"
Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with Fudge, who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly, "The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister."
And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the other into the bright green fire and vanished.

Chapter 2: Spinner's End


Many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the Prime Minister's windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown, rubbish-strewn banks. An immense chimney, relic of a disused mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous. There was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fish-and-chip wrappings in the tall grass.
But then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river. The fox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments, then set off with light, quick strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass.
With a second and louder pop, another hooded figure materialized.
"Wait!"
The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank. There was a flash of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the ground, dead.
The second figure turned over the animal with its toe.
"Just a fox," said a woman's voice dismissively from under the hood. "I thought perhaps an Auror--Cissy, wait!"
But her quarry, who had paused and looked back at the flash of light, was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down.
"Cissy--Narcissa--listen to me--"
The second woman caught the first and seized her arm, but the other wrenched it away.
"Go back, Bella!"
"You must listen to me!"
"I've listened already. I've made my decision. Leave me alone!"
The woman named Narcissa gained the top of the bank, where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow, cobbled street. The other woman, Bella, followed at once. Side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses, their windows dull and blind in the darkness.
"He lives here?" asked Bella in a voice of contempt. "Here? In this Muggle dunghill? We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot--"
But Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road.
"Cissy, wait!"
Bella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second, almost identical street. Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness. The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner, this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other.
"Cissy, you must not do this, you can't trust him--"
"The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn't he?"
"The Dark Lord is... I believe... mistaken," Bella panted, and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone. "In any case, we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark Lord's--"
"Let go, Bella!" snarled Narcissa, and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak, holding it threateningly in the other's face. Bella merely laughed.
"Cissy, your own sister? You wouldn't--"
"There is nothing I wouldn't do anymore!" Narcissa breathed, a note of hysteria in her voice, and as she brought down the wand like a knife, there was another flash of light. Bella let go of her sister's arm as though burned.
"Narcissa!"
But Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer followed again, keeping her distance now, as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses. At last, Narcissa hurried up a street named Spinner's End, over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows, until she reached the very last house, where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room.
She had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing under her breath, had caught up. Together they stood waiting, panting slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze. After a few seconds, they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them, a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes.
Narcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness; the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person.
"Narcissa!" said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that the light fell upon her and her sister too. "What a pleasant surprise!
"Severus," she said in a strained whisper. "May I speak to you? It's urgent."
"But of course."
He stood back to allow her to pass him into the house. Her still-hooded sister followed without invitation.
"Snape," she said curtly as she passed him.
"Bellatrix," he replied, his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them.
They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, which had the feeling of a dark, padded cell. The walls were completely covered in books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling. The place had an air of neglect, as though it was not usually inhabited.
Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw off her cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap. Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as her sister was fair, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw, she did not take her gaze from Snape as she moved to stand behind Narcissa.
"So, what can I do for you?" Snape asked, settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters.
"We... we are alone, aren't we?" Narcissa asked quietly.
'Yes, of course. Well, Wormtail's here, but we're not counting vermin, are we?"
He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen.
"As you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have guests," said Snape lazily.
The man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps and moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes, a pointed nose, and wore an unpleasant simper. His left hand was caressing his right, which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove.
"Narcissa!" he said, in a squeaky voice. "And Bellatrix! How charming--"
"Wormtail will get us drinks, if you'd like them," said Snape. "And then he will return to his bedroom."
Wormtail winced as though Snape had thrown something at him.
"I am not your servant!" he squeaked, avoiding Snape's eye.
"Really? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me."
"To assist, yes--but not to make you drinks and--and clean your house!"
"I had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dangerous assignments," said Snape silkily. "This can be easily arranged: I shall speak to the Dark Lord--"
"I can speak to him myself if I want to!"
"Of course you can," said Snape, sneering. "But in the meantime, bring us drinks. Some of the elf-made wine will do."
Wormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though he might argue, but then turned and headed through a second hidden door. They heard banging and a clinking of glasses. Within seconds he was back, bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray. He dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence, slamming the book-covered door behind him.
Snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters. Narcissa murmured a word of thanks, whilst Bellatrix said nothing, but continued to glower at Snape. This did not seem to discompose him; on the contrary, he looked rather amused.
"The Dark Lord," he said, raising his glass and draining it.
The sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses. As Narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush, "Severus, I'm sorry to come here like this, but I had to see you. I think you are the only one who can help me--"
Snape held up a hand to stop her, then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door. There was a loud bang and a squeal, followed by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs.
"My apologies," said Snape. "He has lately taken to listening at doors, I don't know what he means by it... You were saying, Narcissa?"
She took a great, shuddering breath and started again.
"Severus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been told to say nothing to anyone, but--"
"Then you ought to hold your tongue!" snarled Bellatrix. "Particularly in present company!"
'"Present company'?" repeated Snape sardonically. "And what urn I to understand by that, Bellatrix?"
"That I don't trust you, Snape, as you very well know!"
Narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands. Snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into Bellatrix's glowering face.
"Narcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to say; it will save tedious interruptions. Well, continue, Bellatrix," said Snape. "Why is it that you do not trust me?"
"A hundred reasons!" she said loudly, striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table. "Where to start! Where were you when the Dark Lord fell? Why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished? What have you been doing all these years that you've lived in Dumbledore's pocket? Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcerer's Stone? Why did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn? Where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the Dark Lord? And why, Snape, is Harry Potter still alive, when you have had him at your mercy for five years?"
She paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the color high in her cheeks. Behind her, Narcissa sat motionless, her face still hidden in her hands.
Snape smiled.
"Before I answer you  oh yes, Bellatrix, I am going to answer! You can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back, and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord! Before I answer you, I say, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions? And do you really think that, had I not been able to give satisfactory answers, I would be sitting here talking to you?"
She hesitated.
"I know he believes you, but. . ."
"You think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him? Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest wizard, the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen?"
Bellatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a little discomfited. Snape did not press the point. He picked up his drink again, sipped it, and continued, "You ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell. I was where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because he wished me to spy upon Albus Dumbledore. You know, I presume, that it was on the Dark Lord's orders that I took up the post?"
She nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth, but Snape forestalled her.
"You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished. For the same reason that Avery, Yaxley, the Carrows, Greyback, Lucius"  he inclined his head slightly to Narcissa  "and many others did not attempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am not proud of it, I was wrong, but there it is. ... If he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time, he would have very few followers left."
"He'd have me!" said Bellatrix passionately. "I, who spent many years in Azkaban for him!"
"Yes, indeed, most admirable," said Snape in a bored voice. "Of i nurse, you weren't a lot of use to him in prison, but the gesture was undoubtedly fine "
"Gesture!" she shrieked; in her fury she looked slightly mad. "While I endured the dementors, you remained at Hogwarts, comfortably playing Dumbledore's pet!"
"Not quite," said Snape calmly. "He wouldn't give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, you know. Seemed to think it might, ah, bring about a relapse , . . tempt me into my old ways."
"This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to teach your favorite subject?" she jeered. "Why did you stay there all that time, Snape? Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed dead?"
"Hardly," said Snape, "although the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post: I had sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to give him when he returned, a rather more useful welcome-back present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is. . . ."
"But you stayed "
"Yes, Bellatrix, I stayed," said Snape, betraying a hint of impatience for the first time. "I had a comfortable job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban. They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you know. Dumbledore's protection kept me out of jail; it was most convenient and I used it. I repeat: The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed, so I do not see why you do.
"I think you next wanted to know," he pressed on a little more loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting, "why I stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerer's Stone. That is easily answered. He did not know whether he could trust me. He thought, like you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledore's stooge. He was in a pitiable condition, very weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry. I deeply regret that he did not trust me. He would have returned to power three years sooner. As it was, I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him."
Bellatrix's mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine.
"But you didn't return when he came back, you didn't fly back to him at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn "
"Correct. I returned two hours later. I returned on Dumbledore's orders."
"On Dumbledore's  ?" she began, in tones of outrage.
"Think!" said Snape, impatient again. "Think! By waiting two hours, just two hours, I ensured that I could remain at Hogwarts as a spy! By allowing Dumbledore to think that I was only returning to the Dark Lord's side because I was ordered to, I have been able to pass information on Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix ever since! Consider, Bellatrix: The Dark Mark had been growing stronger for months. I knew he must be about to return, all the Death Eaters knew! I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted to do, to plan my next move, to escape like Karkaroff, didn't I?
"The Dark Lord's initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely, 1 assure you, when I explained that 1 remained faithful, although Dumbledore thought I was his man. Yes, the Dark Lord thought that I had left him forever, but he was wrong."
"But what use have you been?" sneered Bellatrix. "What useful information have we had from you?"
"My information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord," said Snape. "If he chooses not to share it with you "
"He shares everything with me!" said Bellatrix, firing up at once. "He calls me his most loyal, his most faithful "
"Does he?" said Snape, his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief. "Does he still, after the fiasco at the Ministry?"
"That was not my fault!" said Bellatrix, flushing. "The Dark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his most precious  if Lucius hadn't "
"Don't you dare  don't you dare blame my husband!" said Narcissa, in a low and deadly voice, looking up at her sister.
"There is no point apportioning blame," said Snape smoothly. "What is done, is done."
"But not by you!" said Bellatrix furiously. "No, you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers, were you not, Snape?"
"My orders were to remain behind," said Snape. "Perhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord, perhaps you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoenix? And  forgive me  you speak of dangers . . . you were facing six teenagers, were you not?"
"They were joined, as you very well know, by half of the Order before long!" snarled Bellatrix. "And, while we are on the subject of the Order, you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters, don't you?"
"I am not the Secret-Keeper; I cannot speak the name of the place. You understand how the enchantment works, I think? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on the Order. It led, as perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture and murder of Emmeline Vance, and it certainly helped dispose of Sirius Black, though I give you full credit for finishing him off."
He inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression did nor soften.
"You are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry Potter. You could have killed him at any point in the past five years. You have not done it. Why?"
"Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?" asked Snape.
"He . . . lately, we ... I am asking you, Snape!"
"If I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate, making him invincible "
"You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!" she jeered.
"I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived, at least until a year ago. . . ."
"But why did you keep him alive?"
"Have you not understood me? It was only Dumbledore's protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me? But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had survived the Dark Lord's attack. Indeed, many of the Dark Lords old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more. I was curious, 1 admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set fool in the castle.
"Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all. He has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before him. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs, but kill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore close at hand."
"And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you?" asked Bellatrix. "He has no idea of your true allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?"
"I have played my part well," said Snape. "And you overlook Dumbledore's greatest weakness: He has to believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from my Death Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms  though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help. Dumbledore has been a great wizard  oh yes, he has," (for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise), "the Dark Lord acknowledges it. I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him. He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were. But through all these years, he has never stopped trusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord."
Bellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how best to attack Snape next. Taking advantage of her silence, Snape turned to her sister.
"Now . . . you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?"
Narcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair.
"Yes, Severus. I  I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail and . . ."
She closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids.
"The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it," Narcissa continued, her eyes still closed. "He wishes none to know of the plan. It is ... very secret. But "
"If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak," said Snape at once. "The Dark Lord's word is law."
Narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water. Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house.
"There!" she said triumphantly to her sister. "Even Snape says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your silence!"
But Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window, peered through the curtains at the deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk. He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning.
"It so happens that I know of the plan," he said in a low voice. "I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, Narcissa, you would have been guilty of great treachery to the Dark Lord."
"I thought you must know about it!" said Narcissa, breathing more freely. "He trusts you so, Severus. ..."
"You know about the plan?" said Bellatrix, her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage. "You know?"
"Certainly," said Snape. "But what help do you require, Nar-cissa? If you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change his mind, I am afraid there is no hope, none at all."
"Severus," she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks. "My son . . . my only son . . ."
"Draco should be proud," said Bellatrix indifferently. "The Dark Lord is granting him a great honor. And I will say this for Draco: he isn't shrinking away from his duty, he seems glad of a chance to prove himself, excited at the prospect "
Narcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly all the while at Snape.
"That's because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance lor Lucius's mistake, I know it!"
Snape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent, but he could not pretend not to hear her.
"That's why he's chosen Draco, isn't it?" she persisted. "To punish Lucius?"
"If Draco succeeds," said Snape, still looking away from her, "he will be honored above all others."
"But he won't succeed!" sobbed Narcissa. "How can he, when the Dark Lord himself ?"
Bellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve.
"I only meant. . . that nobody has yet succeeded. . . . Severus . . . please . . . You are, you have always been, Draco's favorite teacher. . . . You are Lucius's old friend. ... I beg you. .. . You are the Dark Lord's favorite, his most trusted advisor. . . . Will you speak to him, persuade him  ?"
"The Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not stupid enough to attempt it," said Snape flatly. "I cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in charge. He got himself captured, along with how many others, and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed."
"Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!" choked Narcissa. "He does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be killed trying!"
When Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose what little self-restraint she still possessed. Standing up, she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his robes. Her face close to his, her tears falling onto his chest, she gasped, "You could do it. You could do it instead of Draco, Severus. You would succeed, of course you would, and he would reward you beyond all of us "
Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands. Looking down into her tearstained face, he said slowly, "He intends me to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined that Draco should try first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy."
"In other words, it doesn't matter to him if Draco is killed!"
"The Dark Lord is very angry," repeated Snape quietly. "He failed to hear the prophecy. You know as well as I do, Narcissa, that he does not forgive easily."
She crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and moaning on the floor.
"My only son . . . my only son . . ."
"You should be proud!" said Bellatrix ruthlessly. "If I had sons, I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord!"
Narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair. Snape stooped, seized her by the arms, lifted her up, and steered her back onto the sofa. He then poured her more wine and forced the glass into her hand.
"Narcissa, that's enough. Drink this. Listen to me."
She quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she took a shaky sip.
"It might be possible ... for me to help Draco."
She sat up, her face paper-white, her eyes huge.
"Severus  oh, Severus  you would help him? Would you look after him, see he comes to no harm?"
"I can try."
She flung away her glass; it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at Snape's feet, seized his hand in both of hers, and pressed her lips to it.
"If you are there to protect him . . . Severus, will you swear it? Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?"
"The Unbreakable Vow?"
Snape's expression was blank, unreadable. Bellatrix, however, let out a cackle of triumphant laughter.
"Aren't you listening, Narcissa? Oh, he'll try, I'm sure. . . . The usual empty words, the usual slithering out of action . . . oh, on the Dark Lord's orders, of course!"
Snape did not look at Bellatrix. His black eyes were fixed upon Narcissa's tear-filled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand.
"Certainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable Vow," he said quietly. "Perhaps your sister will consent to be our Bonder."
Bellatrix's mouth fell open. Snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite Narcissa. Beneath Bellatrix's astonished gaze, they grasped right hands.
"You will need your wand, Bellatrix," said Snape coldly.
She drew it, still looking astonished.
"And you will need to move a little closer," he said.
She stepped forward so that she stood over them, and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands.
Narcissa spoke.
"Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?"
"I will," said Snape.
A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire.
"And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?"
"I will," said Snape.
A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing chain.
"And, should it prove necessary... if it seems Draco will fail. . ." whispered Narcissa (Snape's hand twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), "will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?"
There was a moment's silence. Bellatrix watched, her wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide.
"I will," said Snape.
Bellatrix's astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique of flame, which shot from the wand, twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands, like a rope, like a fiery snake.

Chapter 3: Will And Won't


Harry Potter was snoring loudly. He had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours, staring out at the darkening street, and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold windowpane, his glasses askew and his mouth wide open. The misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light drained his face of all color, so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair.
The room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of rubbish. Owl feathers, apple cores, and sweet wrappers littered the floor, a number of spellbooks lay higgledy-piggledy among the tangled robes on his bed, and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk. The headline of one blared:
HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?
Rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the Ministry of Magic, during which He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was sighted once more.
"We're not allowed to talk about it, don't ask me anything" said one agitated Obliviator, who refused to give his name as he left the Ministry last night.
Nevertheless, highly placed sources within the Ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled Hall of Prophecy.
Though Ministry spokes wizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place, a growing number of the Wizarding community believe that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in Azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy. The nature of that prophecy is unknown, although speculation is rife that it concerns Harry Potter, the only person ever known to have survived the Killing Curse, and who is also known to have been at the Ministry on the night in question. Some are going so far as to call Potter "the Chosen One," believing that the prophecy names him as the only one who will be able to rid us of He-Who-Must-No t-Be-Named.
The current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it exists, are unknown, although (ctd. page2, column 5)
A second newspaper lay beside die first. This one bore die headline:
SCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE
Most of this front page was taken up with a large black-and-white picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face. The picture was moving  the man was waving at the ceiling.
Rufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm by the Wizarding community, though rumors of a rift between the new Minister and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour taking office.
Scrimgeours representatives admitted that he had met with Dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the top job, but refused to comment on the topics under discussion. Albus Dumbledore is known to (ctd. page 3, column 2)
To the left of this paper sat another, which had been folded so that a story bearing the title ministry guarantees students' sapety was visible.
Newly appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, spoke today of the tough new measures taken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of students returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this autumn.
"For obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans," said the Minister, although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms, a complex array of countercurses, and a small task force of Aurors dedicated solely to the protection of Hogwarts School.
Most seem reassured by the new Minister's tough stand on student safety. Said Mrs. Augusta Longbottom, "My grandson, Neville  a good friend of Harry Potter's, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and 
But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage .standing on top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master. Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too deeply asleep to hear her.
A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open; it looked expectant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear, sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that coated the very bottom. Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words:
----ISSUED ON BEHALF OF----
The Ministry of Magic
PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AGAINST DARK FORCES
The Wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the Death Eaters. Observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you, your family, and your home from attack.
1. You are advised not to leave the house alone.
2. Particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness. Wherever possible, arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen.
3. Review the security arrangements around your house, making sure that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as Shield and Disillusionment Charms, and, in the case of underage family members, Side-Along-Apparition.
4. Agree on security questions with close friends and family so as to detect Death Eaters masquerading as others by use of the Polyjuice Potion (see page 2).
5. Should you feel that a family member, colleague, friend, or neighbor is acting in a strange manner, contact the Magical Law Enforcement Squad at once. They may have been put under the Imperius Curse (see page 4).
6. Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling place or other building, DO NOT ENTER, but contact the Auror office immediately.
7. Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death Eaters may now be using Inferi (see page 10). Any sighting of an Inferius, or encounter with same, should be reported to the Ministry IMMEDIATELY.
Harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so, making his glasses still more lopsided, but he did not wake up. An alarm clock, repaired by Harry several years ago, ticked loudly on the sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it, held in place by Harry's relaxed hand, was a piece of parchment covered in thin, slanting writing. Harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll, it now lay quite flat.
Dear Harry,
If it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven p.m. to escort you to the Burrow, where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays.
If you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the . Burrow. I shall explain this more fully when I see you.
Kindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping to see you this Friday,
I am, yours most sincerely,
Albus Dumbledore
Though he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o'clock that evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Dumbledore's words; Harry had sent back his "yes" with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could do now was wait: Either Dumbledore was going to come, or he was not.
But Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong  his reply to Dumbledore's letter might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or joke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again. The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage.
The minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and, at that precise moment, the street-lamp outside the window went out.
Harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm. Hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass, he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing cloak was walking up the garden path.
Harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock, knocked over his chair, and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk. Even as he lobbed a set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of crisps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted, "Who the blazes is calling at this lime of night?"
Harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other. He had completely forgotten to warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore might be coming. Feeling both panicky mid close to laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say, "Good evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him?"
Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the doorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length silver hair and beard. Half-moon spectacles were perched on his crooked nose, and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and .1 pointed hat. Vernon Dursley, whose mustache was quite as bushy as Dumbledore's, though black, and who was wearing a puce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes.
"Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming," said Dumbledore pleasantly. "However, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house. It is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times."
He stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him.
"It is a long time since my last visit," said Dumbledore, peering down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon. "I must say, your agapanthus are flourishing."
Vernon Dursley said nothing at all. Harry did not doubt that speech would return to him, and soon  the vein pulsing in his uncles temple was reaching danger point  but something about Dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath. It might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance, but it might, too, have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully.
"Ah, good evening Harry," said Dumbledore, looking up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression. "Excellent, excellent."
These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as far as he was concerned, any man who could look at Harry and say "excellent" was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye.
"I don't mean to be rude " he began, in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable.
"--yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often," Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. "Best to say nothing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this must be Petunia."
The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry's aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly halfway through her usual pre-bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces. Her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock.
"Albus Dumbledore," said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction. "We have corresponded, of course." Harry thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term. "And this must be your son, Dudley?"
Dudley had that moment peered round the living room door. His large, blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and I car. Dumbledore waited a moment or two, apparently to see whether any of the Dursleys were going to say anything, but as the ?.ilcncc stretched on he smiled.
"Shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room?"
Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him. Harry, still clutching the telescope and trainers, jumped the last few stairs and followed Dumbledore, who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign interest. He looked quite extraordinarily out of place.
"Aren't - aren't we leaving, sir?" Harry asked anxiously.
"Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to discuss first," said Dumbledore. "And I would prefer not to do so in the open. We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle's hospitality only a little longer."
"You will, will you?"
Vernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his shoulder, and Dudley skulking behind them both.
"Yes," said Dumbledore simply, "I shall."
He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap. Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position.
"We may as well be comfortable," said Dumbledore pleasantly.
As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away. 
"Sir  what happened to your  ?"
"Later, Harry," said Dumbledore. "Please sit down."
Harry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the Dursleys, who seemed stunned into silence.
"I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment," Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, "but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness."
A third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to each person in the room.
"Madam Rosmertas finest oak-matured mead," said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself.
"Well, Harry," said Dumbledore, turning toward him, "a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us. By us, I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Sirius's will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned."
Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernons head turned, but Harry did not look at him, nor could he think of anything to say except, "Oh. Right."
"This is, in the main, fairly straightforward," Dumbledore went on. "You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts, and you inherit all of Sirius's personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the legacy "
"His godfather's dead?" said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa. Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him. The glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernons head; he attempted to beat it away. "He's dead? His godfather?"
"Yes," said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in the Dursleys. "Our problem," he continued to Harry, as if there had been no interruption, "is that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place."
"He's been left a house?" said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him.
"You can keep using it as headquarters," said Harry. "I don't care. You can have it, I don't really want it." Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave.
"That is generous," said Dumbledore. "We have, however, vacated the building temporarily."
"Why?"
"Well," said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon, who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead, "Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the name of 'Black.' Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood."
A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius's mother that hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry's mind. "I bet there has," he said.
"Quite," said Dumbledore. "And if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius's living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange."
Without realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet; the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor. Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius's killer, inherit his house?
"No," he said.
"Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn't get it either," said Dumbledore calmly. "The situation is fraught with complications. We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it, for example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that ownership has passed from Sirius's hands. It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment. Naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position,"
"But how are you going to find out if I'm allowed to own it?"
"Fortunately," said Dumbledore, "there is a simple test."
He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair, but before he could do anything else, Uncle Vernon shouted, "Will you get these ruddy things off us?"
Harry looked around; all three of the Dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls, their contents flying everywhere.
"Oh, I'm so sorry," said Dumbledore politely, and he raised his wand again. -All three glasses vanished. "But it would have been better manners to drink it, you know."
It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing, keeping his small piggy eyes on Dumbledore's wand.
"You see," Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, "if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited "
He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a nose, giant bat's ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleys' shag carpet and covered in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising shriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory. Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head, as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bellowed, "What the hell is that?"
"Kreacher," finished Dumbledore.
"Kreacher wont, Kreacher won't, Kreacher wont!" croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling his ears. "K readier belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won't go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won't, won't, wont "
"As you can see, Harry," said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher's continued croaks of "wont, won't, won't," "Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership."
"I don't care," said Harry again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping house-elf. "I don't want him."
"Won't, wont, won't, won't "
"You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?"
"Won't, won't, wont, won't "
Harry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius, was repugnant.
"Give him an order," said Dumbledore. "If he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress."
"Won't, won't, wont, WON'T!"
Kreacher's voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of nothing to say, except, "Kreacher, shut up!"
It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.
"Well, that simplifies matters," said Dumbledore cheerfully. "It seems that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher."
"Do I  do I have to keep him with me?" Harry asked, aghast, us Kreacher thrashed around at his feet.
"Not if you don't want to," said Dumbledore. "If I might make ii suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him."
"Yeah," said Harry in relief, "yeah, I'll do that. Er  Kreacher  I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other house-elves."
Kreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deepest loathing and, with another loud crack, vanished.
"Good," said Dumbledore. "There is also the matter of the hip-pogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements "
"No," said Harry at once, "he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak would prefer that."
"Hagrid will be delighted," said Dumbledore, smiling. "He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak's safety, to rechristen him 'Witherwings' for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?"
Erm . ..
"Doubtful that I would turn up?" Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.
"I'll just go and  er  finish off," said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers.
It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding Hedwig's cage in the other, he made his way back downstairs,
He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in the hall, which meant that he had to return to the living room.
Nobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said, "Professor  I'm ready now."
"Good," said Dumbledore. "Just one last thing, then." And he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more.
"As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a years time "
"No," said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since Dumbledore's arrival.
"I'm sorry?" said Dumbledore politely.
"No, he doesn't. He's a month younger than Dudley, and Dudders doesn't turn eighteen until the year after next."
"Ah," said Dumbledore pleasantly, "but in the Wizarding world, we come of age at seventeen."
Uncle Vernon muttered, "Preposterous," but Dumbledore ignored him,
"Now, as you already know, the wizard called Lord Voldemort Was returned to this country. The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter explaining about his parents' murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him ;is though he were your own."
Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer together.
"You did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you."
Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinctively, as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley squeezed between them.
"Us  mistreat Dudders? What d'you  ?" began Uncle Vernon furiously, but Dumbledore raised his ringer for silence, a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb.
"The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house 'home.' However miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen; in other words, at the moment he becomes a man. I ask only this: that you allow Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the protection continues until that time."
None of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was frowning slightly, as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated. Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed.
"Well, Harry . . . time for us to be off," said Dumbledore at last, standing up and straightening his long black cloak. "Until we meet again," he said to the Dursleys, who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned, and after doffing his hat, he swept from the room.
"Bye," said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed Dumbledore, who paused beside Harry's trunk, upon which Hedwig's cage was perched.
"We do not want to be encumbered by these just now," he said, pulling out his wand again. "I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak . . . just in case."
Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within. When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, Dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore then waved his wand again, and the front door opened onto cool, misty darkness.
"And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure."

Chapter 4: Horace Slughorn


Despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that Dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him, Harry felt distinctly awkward as 11 u-y set off down Privet Drive together. He had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of Hogwarts before; there was usually a desk between them. The memory of their last face-to-face encounter kept intruding too, and it rather heightened Harry's sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that occasion, not to mention done his best to smash several of Dumbledore's most prized possessions. 
Dumbledore, however, seemed completely relaxed.
"Keep your wand at the ready, Harry," he said brightly.
"But I thought I'm not allowed to use magic outside school, sir?"
"If there is an attack," said Dumbledore, "I give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you. However, I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight."
"Why not, sir?"
"You are with me," said Dumbledore simply. "This will do, Harry."
He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.
"You have not, of course, passed your Apparition Test," he said.
"No," said Harry. "I thought you had to be seventeen?"
"You do," said Dumbledore. "So you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly. My left, if you don't mind  as you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment."
Harry gripped Dumbledores proffered forearm.
"Very good," said Dumbledore. "Well, here we go."
Harry felt Dumbledores arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew, everything went black; he was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were being forced back into his head; his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then -
He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes. He felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube. It was a few seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had vanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches. His comprehension catching up with his senses, Harry realized that he had just Apparated for the first time in his life.
"Are you all right?" asked Dumbledore, looking down at him solicitously. "The sensation does take some getting used to."
"I'm fine," said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly. "But I think I might prefer brooms. . . ."
Dumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little more lightly around his neck, and said, "This way."
He set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses. According to a clock on a nearby church, it was almost midnight.
"So tell me, Harry," said Dumbledore. "Your scar ... has it been hurting at all?"
Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed i he lightning-shaped mark.
"No," he said, "and I've been wondering about that. I thought it would be burning all the time now Voldemort's getting so powerful again."
He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression.
"I, on the other hand, thought otherwise," said Dumbledore. "Lord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying. It appears that he is now employing Occlumency against you."
"Well, I'm not complaining," said Harry, who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into Voldemort's mind.
They turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a bus shelter. Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore again. "Professor?"
"Harry?"
"Er  where exactly are we?"
"This, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton."
"And what are we doing here?"
"Ah yes, of course, I haven't told you," said Dumbledore. "Well, I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts."
"How can I help with that, sir?" |
"Oh, I think we'll find a use for you," said Dumbledore vaguely. "Left here, Harry."
They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with houses. All the windows were dark. The odd chill that had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here too. Thinking of dementors, Harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket.
"Professor, why couldn't we just Apparate directly into your old colleague's house?"
"Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door," said Dumbledore. "Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry. In any case, most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At Hogwarts, for instance "
" you can't Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds," said Harry quickly. "Hermione Granger told me."
"And she is quite right. We turn left again."
The church clock chimed midnight behind them. Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established, he had more pressing questions to ask.
"Sir, I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sacked. . . ."
"Correct," said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep side street. "He has been replaced, as I am sure you also saw, by Rufus Scrimgeour, who used to be Head of the Auror office."
"Is he ... Do you think he's good?" asked Harry.
"An interesting question," said Dumbledore. "He is able, certainly. A more decisive and forceful personality than Cornelius."
"Yes, but I meant "
"I know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life, does not under-estimate Lord Voldemort."
Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the Daily Prophet had reported, and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed ii. "And ... sir ... I saw about Madam Bones."
"Yes," said Dumbledore quietly. "A terrible loss. She was a great witch. Just up here, I think  ouch."
He had pointed with his injured hand.
"Professor, what happened to your  ?"
"I have no time to explain now," said Dumbledore. "It is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice."
He smiled at Harry, who understood that he was not being snubbed, and that he had permission to keep asking questions.
"Sir  I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about security measures we should all take against the Death Eaters. . . ."
"Yes, I received one myself," said Dumbledore, still smiling. "Did you find it useful?"
"Not really."
"No, I thought not. You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor."
"I didn't. . ." Harry began, not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not.
"For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry. . . although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself."
"Er. . . right," said Harry. "Well, on that leaflet, it said something about Inferi. What exactly are they? The leaflet wasn't very clear."
"They are corpses," said Dumbledore calmly. "Dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizard's bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long time, however, not since Voldemort was last powerful. . . . He killed enough people to make an army of them, of course. This is the place, Harry, just here. . . ."
They were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its own garden. Harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything else, but as they reached the front gate, Dumbledore stopped dead and Harry walked into him.
"Oh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear."
Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink. The front door was hanging off its hinges.
Dumbledore glanced up and down the street. It seemed quite deserted.
"Wand out and follow me, Harry," he said quietly.
He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the front door very slowly, his wand raised and at the ready.
"Lumos."
Dumbledore's wand tip ignited, casting its light up a narrow hallway. To the left, another door stood open. Holding his illuminated wand aloft, Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with Harry right behind him.
A scene of total devastation met their eyes. A grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet, its face cracked, its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its keys strewn across the floor. The wreckage of a fallen chandelier flittered nearby. Cushions lay deflated, feathers oozing from slashes in their sides; fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything. Dumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its light was thrown upon the walls, where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper. Harry's small intake of breath made Dumbledore look around.
"Not pretty, is it?" he said heavily. "Yes, something horrible has happened here."
Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet. Harry followed, gazing around, half-scared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body.
"Maybe there was a fight and  and they dragged him off, Professor?" Harry suggested, trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls.
"I don't think so," said Dumbledore quietly, peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side.
"You mean he's  ?"
"Still here somewhere? Yes."
And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled, "Ouch!"
"Good evening, Horace," said Dumbledore, straightening up again.
Harrys jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye.
"There was no need to stick the wand in that hard," he said gruffly, clambering to his feet. "It hurt."
The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache, and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas. The top of his head barely reached Dumbledore's chin.
"What gave it away?" he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still rubbing his lower belly. He seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair.
"My dear Horace," said Dumbledore, looking amused, "if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house."
The wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead.
"The Dark Mark," he muttered. "Knew there was something ... ah well. Wouldn't have had time anyway, I'd only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room."
He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter.
"Would you like my assistance clearing up?" asked Dumbledore politely.
"Please," said the other.
They stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the short round one, and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion.
The furniture flew back to its original places; ornaments reformed in midair, feathers zoomed into their cushions; torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited; a vast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon a desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed everywhere, and the walls wiped themselves clean.
"What kind of blood was that, incidentally?" asked Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather flock.
"On the walls? Dragon," shouted the wizard called Horace, as, with a deafening grinding and tinkling, the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling.
There was a final plunk from the piano, and silence.
"Yes, dragon," repeated the wizard conversationally. "My last bottle, and prices are sky-high at the moment. Still, it might be reusable."
He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light, examining the thick liquid within.
"Hmm. Bit dusty."
He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It was then that his gaze fell upon Harry.
"Oho," he said, his large round eyes flying to Harry's forehead and the lightning-shaped scar it bore. "Oho!"
"This," said Dumbledore, moving forward to make the introduction, "is Harry Potter. Harry, this is an old Friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn."
Slughorn turned on Dumbledore, his expression shrewd. "So that's how you thought you'd persuade me, is it? Well, the answer's no, Albus."
He pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation.
"I suppose we can have a drink, at least?" asked Dumbledore. "For old time's sake?"
Slughorn hesitated.
"All right then, one drink," he said ungraciously.
Dumbledore smiled at Harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so recently impersonated, which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp. Harry took the seat with the distinct impression that Dumbledore, for some reason, wanted to keep him as visible as possible. Certainly when Slughorn, who had been busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face the room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry.
"Hmpf," he said, looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes. "Here " He gave a drink to Dumbledore, who had sat down without invitation, thrust the tray at Harry, and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence. His legs were so short they did not touch the floor.
"Well, how have you been keeping, Horace?" Dumbledore asked.
"Not so well," said Slughorn at once. "Weak chest. Wheezy. Rheumatism too. Can't move like I used to. Well, that's to be expected. Old age. Fatigue."
"And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice," said Dumbledore. "You can't have had more than three minutes' warning?"
Slughorn said, half irritably, half proudly, "Two. Didn't hear my Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a bath. Still," he added sternly, seeming to pull himself back together again, "the fact remains that I'm an old man, Albus. A tired old man who's earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts."
He certainly had those, thought Harry, looking around the room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady.
"You're not yet as old as I am, Horace," said Dumbledore.
"Well, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself," said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dumbledore's injured hand. "Reactions not what they were, I see."
"You're quite right," said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened ringers; the sight of them made the back of Harry's neck prickle unpleasantly. "1 am undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other hand . . ."
He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its compensations, and Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle. Slughorn's eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and Harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead.
"So, all these precautions against intruders, Horace ... are they for the Death Eaters' benefit, or mine?" asked Dumbledore.
"What would the Death Eaters want with a poor broken-down old buffer like me?" demanded Slughorn.
"I imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion, torture, and murder," said Dumbledore. "Are you really telling me that they haven't come recruiting yet?"
Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, then muttered, "I haven't given them the chance. I've been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from Muggle house to Muggle house  the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands  it's been very pleasant, I'll be sorry to leave. It's quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneako-scopes and make sure the neighbors don't spot you bringing in the piano."
"Ingenious," said Dumbledore. "But it sounds a rather tiring existence for a broken-down old buffer in search of a quiet life. Now, if you were to return to Hogwarts "
"If you're going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school, you can save your breath, Albus! I might have been in hiding, but some funny rumors have reached me since Dolores Umbridge left! If that's how you treat teachers these days "
"Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd," said Dumbledore. "I think you, Horace, would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs 'filthy half-breeds.'"
"That's what she did, did she?" said Slughorn. "Idiotic woman. Never liked her."
Harry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn looked round at him.
"Sorry," Harry said hastily. "It's just  I didn't like her either."
Dumbledore stood up rather suddenly.
"Are you leaving?" asked Slughorn at once, looking hopeful.
"No, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom," said Dumbledore.
"Oh," said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. "Second on the left down the hall."
Dumbledore strode from the room. Once the door had closed behind him, there was silence. After a few moments, Slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a furtive look at Harry, then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it, warming his wide behind.
"Don't think I don't know why he's brought you," he said abruptly.
Harry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughorn's watery eyes slid over Harry's scar, this time taking in the rest of his face.
"You look very like your father."
"Yeah, I've been told," said Harry.
"Except for your eyes. You've got -"
"My mother's eyes, yeah." Harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing.
"Hmpf. Yes, well. You shouldn't have favorites as a teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your mother," Slughorn added, in answer to Harrys questioning look. "Lily Evans. One of the brightest I ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too." <
"Which was your House?"
"I was Head of Slytherin," said Slughorn. "Oh, now," he went on quickly, seeing the expression on Harry's face and wagging a stubby ringer at him, "don't go holding that against me! You'll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must have done  been in the papers for the last couple of years  died a few weeks ago "
It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry's intestines and held them tight.
"Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father's at school. The whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame  he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came along, but I'd have liked the set."
He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction. Apparently lost in memories, he gazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside.
"Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn't believe it when I found out. Thought she must have been pure-blood, she was so good."
"One of my best friends is Muggle-born," said Harry, "and she's the best in our year."
"Funny how that sometimes happens, isn't it?" said Slughorn.
"Not really," said Harry coldly.
Slughorn looked down at him in surprise. "You mustn't think I'm prejudiced!" he said. "No, no, no! Haven't I just said your mother was one of my all-time favorite students? And there was Dirk Cresswell in the year after her too  now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, of course  another Muggle-born, a very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside information on the goings-on at Gringotts!"
He bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self-satisfied way, and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser, each peopled with tiny moving occupants.
"All ex-students, all signed. You'll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, he's always interested to hear my take on the day's news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes  a hamper every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkisss who gave him his first job! And at the back  you'll see her if you just crane your neck  that's Gwenog Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies. . . . People are always astonished to hear I'm on first-name terms with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them!"
This thought seemed to cheer him up enormously.
"And all these people know where to find you, to send you stuff?" asked Harry, who could not help wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked down Slughorn if hampers of sweets, Quidditch tickets, and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him.
The smile slid from Slughorn's face as quickly as the blood from his walls.
"Of course not," he said, looking down at Harry. "I have been out of touch with everybody for a year."
Harry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn himself; he looked quite unsettled for a moment. Then he shrugged.
"Still . . . the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times. All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but taking up a post at Hog-warts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix! And while I'm sure they're very admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don't personally fancy the mortality rate -"
"You don't have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts," said Harry, who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice: It was hard to sympathize with Slughorn's cosseted existence when he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living on rats. "Most of the teachers aren't in it, and none of them has ever been killed  well, unless you count Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort."
Harry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear Voldemort's name spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which Harry ignored.
"I reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledore's headmaster; he's supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever feared, isn't he?" Harry went on.
Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: He seemed to be thinking over Harry's words.
"Well, yes, it is true that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has never sought a fight with Dumbledore," he muttered grudgingly. "And I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Kilters, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a friend . . . in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to Albus. . . . I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones's death did not shake me. . . . If she, with all her Ministry contacts and protection . . ."
Dumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house.
"Oh, there you are, Albus," he said. "You've been a very long lime. Upset stomach?"
"No, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines," said Dumbledore. "I do love knitting patterns. Well, Harry, we have trespassed upon Horace's hospitality quite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave."
Not at all reluctant to obey, Harry jumped to his feet. Slughorn sinned taken aback.
"You're leaving?"
"Yes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see one."
"Lost. . .?"
Slughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket.
"Well, I'm sorry you don't want the job, Horace," said Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute. "Hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again. Our greatly increased security notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, should you wish to."
"Yes . . . well . . . very gracious ... as I say ..."
"Good-bye, then."
"Bye," said Harry.
They were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them.
"All right, all right, I'll do it!"
Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room.
"You will come out of retirement?"
"Yes, yes," said Slughorn impatiently. "I must be mad, but yes."
"Wonderful," said Dumbledore, beaming. "Then, Horace, we shall see you on the first of September."
"Yes, I daresay you will," grunted Slughorn.
As they set off down the garden path, Slughorn's voice floated after them, "I'll want a pay rise, Dumbledore!"
Dumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut behind them, and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist.
"Well done, Harry," said Dumbledore.
"I didn't do anything," said Harry in surprise.
"Oh yes you did. You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did you like him?"
"Er..."
Harry wasn't sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. He supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the contrary, much too surprised that a Muggle-born should make a good witch.
"Horace," said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this, "likes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat  more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts, some-limcs for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions, forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin liaison Office."
Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer.
"I tell you all this," Dumbledore continued, "not to turn you against Horace  or, as we must now call him, Professor Slughorn  but to put you on your guard. He will undoubtedly try to collect you, Harry. You would be the jewel of his collection; 'the Boy Who Lived' ... or, as they call you these days, 'the Chosen One.'"
At these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over Harry. He was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him: Neither can live while the other survives . . .
Dumbledore had stopped walking, level with the church they had passed earlier.
"This will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm."
Braced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, but still found it unpleasant. When the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world: the Burrow. In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it. Ron was in there . . . and so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he knew. . . .
"If you don't mind, Harry," said Dumbledore, as they passed through the gate, "I'd like a few words with you before we part. In private. Perhaps in here?"
Dumbledore pointed toward a run-down stone outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks. A little puzzled, Harry followed Dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard. Dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at Harry.
"I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you."
Harry swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted him. He did not think he could stand to discuss Sirius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle Vernon say "His godfather's dead?" and even worse to hear Siriuss name thrown out casually by Slughorn.
"It was cruel," said Dumbledore softly, "that you and Sirius had such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship."
Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing Dumbledore's hat. He could tell that Dumbledore understood, that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived, Harry had spent nearly all his time at the Dursleys' lying on his bed, refusing meals, and staring at the misted window, full of the chill emptiness i hat he had come to associate with dementors.
"It's just hard," Harry said finally, in a low voice, "to realize he won't write to me again."
His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt stupid for admitting it, but the fact that he had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened to him, almost like a parent, had been one of the best things about discovering his godfather . . . and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort again. . . .
"Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before," said Dumbledore gently. "Naturally, the loss is devastating. . . .
"But while I was at the Dursleys' ..." interrupted Harry, his voice growing stronger, "I realized I cant shut myself away or  or crack up. Sirius wouldn't have wanted that, would he? And anyway, life's too short. . . . Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance. ... It could be me next, couldn't it? But if it is," he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore's blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, "I'll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it."
"Spoken both like your mother and father's son and Sirius's true godson!" said Dumbledore, with an approving pat on Harry's back. "I take my hat off to you  or I would, if I were not afraid of showering you in spiders.
"And now, Harry, on a closely related subject... I gather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet over the last two weeks?"
"Yes," said Harry, and his heart beat a little faster.
"Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy?"
"Yes," said Harry again. "And now everyone knows that I'm the one 
"No, they do not," interrupted Dumbledore. "There are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort, and they are both standing in this smelly, spidery broom shed. It is true, however, that many have guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the prophecy concerned you.
"Now, I think I am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said?"
"No," said Harry.
"A wise decision, on the whole," said Dumbledore. "Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger. Yes," he continued, when Harry looked startled, "I think they ought to know. You do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them."
"I didn't want "
" to worry or frighten them?" said Dumbledore, surveying Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles. "Or perhaps, to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened? You need your friends, Harry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away."
Harry said nothing, but Dumbledore did not seem to require an answer. He continued, "On a different, though related, subject, it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year."
"Private  with you?" said Harry, surprised out of his preoccupied silence.
"Yes. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in your education."
What will you be teaching me, sir?"
"Oh, a little of this, a little of that," said Dumbledore airily.
Harry waited hopefully, but Dumbledore did not elaborate, so ho asked something else that had been bothering him slightly.
"If I'm having lessons with you, I won't have to do Occlumency lessons with Snape, will I?"
''Professor Snape, Harry  and no, you will not."
"Good," said Harry in relief, "because they were a "
He stopped, careful not to say what he really thought.
"I think the word 'fiasco' would be a good one here," said Dumbledore, nodding.
Harry laughed.
"Well, that means I won't see much of Professor Snape from now on," he said, "because he won't let me carry on Potions unless I get 'Outstanding' in my OWL., which I know I haven't."
"Don't count your owls before they are delivered," said Dumbledore gravely. "Which, now I think of it, ought to be some time later today. Now, two more things, Harry, before we part.
"Firstly, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all times from this moment onward. Even within Hogwarts itself. Just in case, you understand me?"
Harry nodded.
"And lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide. These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly  all their post, for instance, is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on. They do not mind in the slightest, for their only concern is your safety. However, it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them."
"I understand," said Harry quickly.
"Very well, then," said Dumbledore, pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard. "I see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are."

Chapter 5: An Excess Of Phlegm


Harry and Dumbledore approached the back door of the Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; Harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed. Dumbledore knocked three times and Harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window.
"Who's there?" said a nervous voice he recognized as Mrs. Weasley's. "Declare yourself!"
"It is I, Dumbledore, bringing Harry."
The door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, short, plump, and wearing an old green dressing gown.
"Harry, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright, you said not to expect you before morning!"
"We were lucky," said Dumbledore, ushering Harry over the threshold. "Slughorn proved much more persuadable than I had expected. Harry's doing, of course. Ah, hello, Nymphadora!"
Harry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was not alone, despite the lateness of the hour. A young witch with a pale, heart-shaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands.
"Hello, Professor," she said. " Wotcher, Harry."
"Hi, Tonks."
Harry thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there was something forced in her smile. Certainly her appearance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of bubble-gum-pink hair.
"I'd better be off," she said quickly, standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders. "Thanks for the tea and sympathy, Molly"
"Please don't leave on my account," said Dumbledore courteously, "I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour."
"No, no, I need to get going," said Tonks, not meeting Dumbledore's eyes. " 'Night ?quot;
"Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, Remus and Mad-Eye are coming ??"
"No, really, Molly. . . thanks anyway. . . Good night, every-one.
Tonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air. Harry noticed that Mrs. Weasley looked troubled.
"Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry," said Dumbledore. "Take care of yourself. Molly, your servant."
He made Mrs. Weasley a bow and followed Tonks, vanishing at precisely the same spot. Mrs. Weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of -=-ilu* lantern on the table to examine his appearance.
"You're like Ron," she sighed, looking him up and down. "Both of you look as though you've had Stretching jinxes put on you. -=-I Nwcar Ron's grown four inches since I last bought him school robes. Are you hungry, Harry?"
"Yeah, I am," said Harry, suddenly realizing just how hungry he was,
"Sit down, dear, I'll knock something up."
As Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face lumped onto his knees and settled there, purring.
"So Hermione's here?" he asked happily as he tickled Crookshanks behind the ears.
"Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday," said Mrs. Weasley, rapping a large iron pot with her wand. It bounced onto the -=-Itovc with a loud clang and began to bubble at once. "Everyone's in bed, of course, we didn't expect you for hours. Here you are ?quot;
She tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew toward Harry, and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid a bowl nearly beneath it just in lime to catch the stream of thick, steaming onion soup.
"Bread, dear?"
"Thanks, Mrs. Weasley."
She waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table; as the loaf sliced itself and -=-llie soup pot dropped back onto the stove, Mrs. Weasley sat down opposite him.
"So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?"
Harry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak.
"He taught Arthur and me," said Mrs. Weasley. "He was at Hog-warts for ages, started around the same time as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?"
His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head.
"I know what you mean," said Mrs. Weasley, nodding wisely. "Of course he can be charming when he wants to be, but Arthur's never liked him much. The Ministry's littered with Slughorn's old favorites, he was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had much time for Arthur ?didn't seem to think he was enough of a highflier. Well, that just shows you, even Slughorn makes mistakes. I don't know whether Ron's told you in any of his letters ?it's only just happened ?but Arthur's been promoted!"
It could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had been bursting to say this.
Harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering. "That's great!" he gasped.
"You are sweet," beamed Mrs. Weasley, possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news. "Yes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation, and Arthur's heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. It's a big job, he's got ten people reporting to him now!"
"What exactly ??"
"Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are supposed to guard against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters. You can imagine the kind of thing ?so-called protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off. . . . Well, in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus Hotelier, who've never done an honest day's work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is, but every now and then something really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you see, it's a very important job, and I tell him it's just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and loasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish." Mrs. Weasley ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs.
"Is Mr. Weasley still at work?" Harry asked.
"Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he's a tiny bit late. ... He said he'd be back around midnight. . . ."
She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table. Harry recognized it at once: It had nine hands, each inscribed with the name of a family member, and usually hung on i he Weasleys' sitting room wall, though its current position suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her. Every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at "mortal peril."
"It's been like that for a while now," said Mrs. Weasley, in an un-convincingly casual voice, "ever since You-Know-Who came back into the open. I suppose everybody's in mortal danger now. ... I don't think it can be just our family . . . but I don't know anyone else who's got a clock like this, so I can't check. Oh!"
With a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock's face. Mr. Weasley's hand had switched to "traveling."
"He's coming!"
And sure enough, a moment later there was a knock on the back door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up and hurried to it; with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly, "Arthur, is that you?"
"Yes," came Mr. Weasley's weary voice. "But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question!"
"Oh, honestly..."
"Molly!"
"All right, all right. . . What is your dearest ambition?"
"To find out how airplanes stay up."
Mrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob, but apparently Mr. Weasley was holding tight to it on the other side, because the door remained firmly shut.
"Molly! I've got to ask you your question first!"
"Arthur, really, this is just silly. ..."
"What do you like me to call you when we're alone together?"
Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red; he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl.
-=-"Mollywobbles," whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door.
"Correct," said Mr. Weasley. "Now you can let me in."
Mrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired wizard wearing horn-rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak.
"I still don't see why we have to go through that every time you come home," said Mrs. Weasley, still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak. "I mean, a Death Eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you!"
"I know, dear, but it's Ministry procedure, and I have to set an example. Something smells good ?onion soup?"
Mr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table.
"Harry! We didn't expect you until morning!"
They shook hands, and Mr. Weasley dropped into the chair beside Harry as Mrs. Weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too.
"Thanks, Molly. It's been a tough night. Some idiot's started selling Metamorph-Medals. Just sling them around your neck and you'll be able to change your appearance at will. A hundred thousand disguises, all for ten Galleons!"
"And what really happens when you put them on?"
"Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, but a couple of people have also sprouted tentacle like warts all over their bodies. As if St. Mungo's didn't have enough to do already!"
"It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny," said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly. "Are you sure ??"
"Of course I am!" said Mr. Weasley. "The boys wouldn't do anything like that now, not when people are desperate for protection!"
"So is that why you're late, Metamorph-Medals?"
"No, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we got there. ..."
Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand.
"Bed," said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once. "I've got Fred and George's room all ready for you, you'll have it to yourself."
"Why, where are they?"
"Oh, they're in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as they're so busy," said Mrs. Weasley. "I must say, I didn't approve at first, but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business! Come on, dear, your trunks already up there."
"'Night, Mr. Weasley," said Harry, pushing back his chair. Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room.
"G'night, Harry," said Mr. Weasley.
Harry saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands were once again at "mortal peril."
Fred and George's bedroom was on the second floor. Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow. Though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window, their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what Harry thought was gunpowder. A considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed cardboard boxes, amongst which stood Harry's school trunk. The room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse.
Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe, then took off through the window; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. Harry bade Mrs. Weasley good night, put on pajamas, and got into one of the beds. There was something hard inside the pillowcase. He groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and-orange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over and was instantly asleep.
Seconds later, or so it seemed to Harry, he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open. Sitting bolt upright, he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. Shielding them with one hand, he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other.
"Wuzzgoinon?"
"We didn't know you were here already!" said a loud and excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head.
"Ron, don't hit him!" said a girl's voice reproachfully.
Harry's hand found his glasses and he shoved them on, though I he light was so bright he could hardly see anyway. A long, looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment; he blinked and Ron Weasley came into focus, grinning down at him.
"All right?"
"Never been better," said Harry, rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows. "You?"
"Not bad," said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it. "When did you get here? Mum's only just told us!"
"About one o'clock this morning."
"Were the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?"
"Same as usual," said Harry, as Hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed, "they didn't talk to me much, but I like it better that way. How're you, Hermione?"
"Oh, I'm fine," said Hermione, who was scrutinizing Harry as though he was sickening for something. He thought he knew what was behind this, and as he had no wish to discuss Sirius's death or any other miserable subject at the moment, he said, "What's the time? Have I missed breakfast?"
"Don't worry about that, Mum's bringing you up a tray; she reckons you look underfed," said Ron, rolling his eyes. "So, what's been going on?"
"Nothing much, I've just been stuck at my aunt and uncle's, haven't I?"
"Come off it!" said Ron. "You've been off with Dumbledore!"
"It wasn't that exciting. He just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement. His name's Horace Slughorn."
"Oh," said Ron, looking disappointed. "We thought ?quot;
Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.
"we thought it'd be something like that."
"You did?" said Harry, amused.
"Yeah . . . yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, don't we? So, er, what's he like?"
"He looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head of Slytherin," said Harry. "Something wrong, Hermione?"
She was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment. She rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile.
"No, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like he'll be a good teacher?"
"Dunno," said Harry. "He can't be worse than Umbridge, can he?"
"I know someone who's worse than Umbridge," said a voice from the doorway. Ron's younger sister slouched into the room, looking irritable. "Hi, Harry."
"What's up with you?" Ron asked.
"It's her," said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry's bed. "She's driving me mad."
"What's she done now?" asked Hermione sympathetically.
"It's the way she talks to me ?you'd think I was about three!"
"I know," said Hermione, dropping her voice. "She's so full of herself."
Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about Mrs. Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for saying angrily, "Can't you two lay off her for five seconds?"
"Oh, that's right, defend her," snapped Ginny. "We all know you can't get enough of her."
This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron's mother. Starting to feel that he was missing something, Harry said, "Who are you ??"
But his question was answered before he could finish it. The bedroom door flew open again, and Harry instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off the bed onto the floor.
A young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray.
"'Arry," she said in a throaty voice. "Eet 'as been too long!"
As she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs. Weasley was revealed, bobbing along in her wake, looking rather cross.
"There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do it myself!"
"Eet was no trouble," said Fleur Delacour, setting the tray across Harry's knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek: He felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn. "I 'ave been longing to see -=-'itn. You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She never stops talking about 'Arry Potter. She will be delighted to see you again."
"Oh ... is she here too?" Harry croaked.
"No, no, silly boy," said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, "I mean next summer, when we ?but do you not know?"
Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said, "We hadn't got around to telling him yet."
Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face.
"Bill and I are going to be married!"
"Oh," said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one another's gaze. "Wow. Er ?congratulations!"
She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
"Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very 'ard, and I only work part-time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me 'ere for a few days to get to know 'is family properly. I was so pleased to 'ear you would be coming ?zere isn't much to do 'ere, unless you like cooking and chickens! Well ?enjoy your breakfast, 'Arry!"
With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room, closing the door quietly behind her.
Mrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like -=-"tchah!"
"Mum hates her," said Ginny quietly.
"I do not hate her!" said Mrs. Weasley in a cross whisper. "I just think they've hurried into this engagement, that's all!"
"They've known each other a year," said Ron, who looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed door.
"Well, that's not very long! I know why it's happened, of course. Its all this uncertainty with You-Know-Who coming back, people think they might be dead tomorrow, so they're rushing all sorts of decisions they'd normally take time over. It was the same last time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and center ?quot;
"Including you and Dad," said Ginny slyly.
"Yes, well, your father and I were made for each other, what was the point in waiting?" said Mrs. Weasley. "Whereas Bill and Fleur . . . well. . . what have they really got in common? He's a hardworking, down-to-earth sort of person, whereas she's ?quot;
"A cow," said Ginny, nodding. "But Bill's not that down-to-earth. He's a Curse-Breaker, isn't he, he likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour. ... I expect that's why he's gone for Phlegm."
"Stop calling her that, Ginny," said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Harry and Hermione laughed. "Well, I'd better get on. ... Eat your eggs while they're warm, Harry."
Looking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed slightly punch-drunk; he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water.
"Don't you get used to her if she's staying in the same house?" Harry asked.
"Well, you do," said Ron, "but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then ..."
"It's pathetic," said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall.
"You don't really want her around forever?" Ginny asked Ron incredulously. When he merely shrugged, she said, "Well, Mum's going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything."
"How's she going to manage that?" asked Harry.
"She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I think she's hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead. I hope he does, I'd much rather have her in the family."
"Yeah, that'll work," said Ron sarcastically. "Listen, no bloke in his right mind's going to fancy Tonks when Fleur's around. I mean, Tonks is okay-looking when she isn't doing stupid things to her hair and her nose, but ?quot;
"She's a damn sight nicer than Phlegm? said Ginny.
"And she's more intelligent, she's an Auror!" said Hermione from the corner.
"Fleur's not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament," said Harry.
"Not you as well!" said Hermione bitterly.
"I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ' 'Any,' do you?" asked Ginny scornfully.
"No," said Harry, wishing he hadn't spoken, "I was just saying, Phlegm ?I mean, Fleur ?quot;
"I'd much rather have Tonks in the family," said Ginny. "At least she's a laugh."
"She hasn't been much of a laugh lately," said Ron. "Every time I've seen her she's looked more like Moaning Myrtle."
"That's not fair," snapped Hermione. "She still hasn't got over what happened . . . you know ... I mean, he was her cousin!"
Harry's heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation.
"Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other!" said Ron. "Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met ?quot;
"That's not the point," said Hermione. "She thinks it was her limit he died!"
"How does she work that one out?" asked Harry, in spite of himself.
"Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn't she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldn't have killed Sirius."
"That's stupid," said Ron.
"It's survivor's guilt," said Hermione. "I know Lupin's tried to talk her round, but she's still really down. She's actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing!"
"With her ?"
"She can't change her appearance like she used to," explained Hermione. "I think her powers must have been affected by shock, or something."
"I didn't know that could happen," said Harry.
"Nor did I," said Hermione, "but I suppose if you're really depressed ..."
The door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her head in. "Ginny," she whispered, "come downstairs and help me with the lunch."
"I'm talking to this lot!" said Ginny, outraged.
"Now!" said Mrs. Weasley, and withdrew.
"She only wants me there so she doesn't have to be alone with Phlegm!" said Ginny crossly. She swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina.
"You lot had better come down quickly too," she said as she left.
Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and George's boxes, though every now and then she cast sideways looks at Harry. Ron, who was now helping himself to Harrys toast, was still gazing dreamily at the door.
"What's this?" Hermione asked eventually, holding up what looked like a small telescope.
"Dunno," said Ron, "but if Fred and -=-GeorgeVe left it here, it's probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be careful"
"Your mum said the shop's going well," said Harry. "Said Fred and George have got a real flair for business."
"That's an understatement," said Ron. "They're raking in the Galleons! I can't wait to see the place, we haven't been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says Dad's got to be there for extra security and he's been really busy at work, but it sounds excellent."
"And what about Percy?" asked Harry; the third-eldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family. "Is he talking to your mum and dad again?"
"Nope," said Ron.
"But he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being back ?quot;
"Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right," said Hermione. "I heard him telling your mum, Ron."
"Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say," said Ron.
"He's going to be giving me private lessons this year," said Harry conversationally.
Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped.
"You kept that quiet!" said Ron.
"I only just remembered," said Harry honestly. "He told me last night in your broom shed."
"Blimey . . . private lessons with Dumbledore!" said Ron, looking impressed. "I wonder why he's . . . ?"
His voice tailed away. Harry saw him and Hermione exchange looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork, his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed. Dumbledore had said to do it. ... Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork, which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap, and said, "I don't know exactly why he's going to be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy."
Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the impression that both had frozen. He continued, still speaking to his fork, "You know, the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry."
"Nobody knows what it said, though," said Hermione quickly. "It got smashed."
"Although the Prophet says ?quot; began Ron, but Hermione said, "Shh!"
"The Prophet's got it right," said Harry, looking up at them both with a great effort: Hermione seemed frightened and Ron amazed. "That glass ball that smashed wasn't the only record of the prophecy. I heard the whole thing in Dumbledore's office, he was the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell me. From what it said," Harry took a deep breath, "it looks like I'm the one who's got to finish off Voldemort. ... At least, it said neither of us could live while the other survives."
The three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment. Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke.
"Hermione!" shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash.
Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye.
"I squeezed it and it ?it punched me!" she gasped.
And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope.
"Don't worry," said Ron, who was plainly trying not to laugh, "Mum'll fix that, she's good at healing minor injuries ?quot;
"Oh well, never mind that now!" said Hermione hastily. "Harry, oh, Harry. . ."
She sat down on the edge of his bed again.
"We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry . . . Obviously, we didn't want to say anything to you, but from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy, how it was about you and Voldemort, well, we thought it might be something like this. . . . Oh, Harry . . ." She stared at him, then whispered, "Are you scared?"
"Not as much as I was," said Harry. "When I first heard it, I was . . . but now, it seems as though I always knew I'd have to face him in the end. . . ."
"When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person, we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy," said Ron eagerly. "And we were kind of right, weren't we? He wouldn't be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner, wouldn't waste his time ?he must think you've got a chance!"
"That's true," said Hermione. "1 wonder what he'll teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, probably. . . powerful countercurses . . . anti-jinxes . . ."
Harry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them.
"...and evasive enchantments generally," concluded Hermione. "Well, at least you know one lesson you'll be having this year, that's one more than Ron and me. I wonder when our OWL results will come?"
"Cant be long now, it's been a month," said Ron.
"Hang on," said Harry, as another part of last night's conversation came back to him. "I think Dumbledore said our OWL results would be arriving today!"
"Today?" shrieked Hermione. "Today? But why didn't you ?oh my God ?you should have said ?quot;
She leapt to her feet.
"I'm going to see whether any owls have come. ..."
But when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later, fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation, while Mrs. Weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda.
"It just won't budge," Mrs. Weasley was saying anxiously, standing over Hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of The Healer's Helpmate open at "Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions." "This has always worked before, I just can't understand it."
"It'll be Fred and George's idea of a funny joke, making sure it can't come off," said Ginny.
"But it's got to come off!" squeaked Hermione. "I can't go around looking like this forever!"
"You won't, dear, we'll find an antidote, don't worry," said Mrs. Weasley soothingly.
"Bill told me W Fred and George are very amusing!" said Fleur, smiling serenely.
"Yes, I can hardly breathe for laughing," snapped Hermione.
She jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen, twisting her fingers together.
"Mrs. Weasley, you're quite, quite sure no owls have arrived this morning?"
"Yes, dear, I'd have noticed," said Mrs. Weasley patiently. "But it's barely nine, there's still plenty of time. . . ."
"I know I messed up Ancient Runes," muttered Hermione feverishly, "I definitely made at least one serious mistranslation. And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all. I thought Transfiguration went all right at the time, but looking back ?quot;
"Hermione, will you shut up, you're not the only one who's nervous!" barked Ron. "And when you've got your eleven 'Outstanding Oils .. ."
"Don't, don't, don't!" said Hermione, flapping her hands hysterically. "I know I've failed everything!"
"What happens if we fail?" Harry asked the room at large, but it was again Hermione who answered.
"We discuss our options with our Head of House, I asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term."
Harry's stomach squirmed. He wished he had eaten less breakfast.
"At Beauxbatons," said Fleur complacently, "we 'ad a different way of doing things. I think eet was better. We sat our examinations after six years of study, not five, and then ?quot;
Fleur's words were drowned in a scream. Hermione was pointing through the kitchen window. Three black specks were clearly visible in the sky, growing larger all the time.
"They're definitely owls," said Ron hoarsely, jumping up to join Hermione at the window.
"And there are three of them," said Harry, hastening to her other side.
"One for each of us," said Hermione in a terrified whisper. "Oh no ... oh no ... oh no ..."
She gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the elbows.
The owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three handsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house, was carrying a large square envelope.
"Oh no!" squealed Hermione.
Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All three of them lifted their right legs.
Harry moved forward. The letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied it with fumbling fingers. To his left, Ron was trying to detach his own results; to his right, Hermione's hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble.
Nobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Harry managed to detach the envelope. He slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside.

Harry James Potter has achieved:

Divination P

History of Magic D
Potions E
Transfiguration E
Harry read the parchment through several times, his breathing becoming easier with each reading. It was all right: He had always known that he would fail Divination, and he had had no chance of passing History of Magic, given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination, but he had passed everything else! He ran his finger down the grades . . . he had passed well in Transfiguration and Herbology, he had even exceeded expectations at Potions! And best of all, he had achieved "Outstanding" at Defense Against the Dark Arts!
He looked around. Hermione had her back to him and her head bent, but Ron was looking delighted.
"Only failed Divination and History of Magic, and who cares about them?" he said happily to Harry. "Here ?swap ?quot;
Harry glanced down Ron's grades: There were no "Outstandings" there. . . .
"Knew you'd be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts," said Ron, punching Harry on the shoulder. "We've done all right, haven't we?"
"Well done!" said Mrs. Weasley proudly, ruffling Ron's hair. "Seven OWLs, that's more than Fred and George got together!"
"Hermione?" said Ginny tentatively, for Hermione still hadn't turned around. "How did you do?"
"I--not bad," said Hermione in a small voice.
"Oh, come off it," said Ron, striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand. "Yep ?ten 'Outstandings' and one 'Exceeds Expectations' at Defense Against the Dark Arts." He looked down at her, half-amused, half-exasperated. "You're actually disappointed, aren't you?"
Hermione shook her head, but Harry laughed.
"Well, we're N.E.W.T. students now!" grinned Ron. "Mum, are there any more sausages?"
Harry looked back down at his results. They were as good as he could have hoped for. He felt just one tiny twinge of regret. . . . This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror. He had not secured the required Potions grade. He had known all along that he wouldn't, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E.
It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn't really think of anything else he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago. . . . Neither can live while the other survives. . . .Wouldn't he be living up to the prophecy, and giving himself the best chance of survival, if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill Voldemort?

Chapter 6: Draco's Detour


Harry remained within the confines of the Burrow's garden over the next few weeks. He spent most of his days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys' orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny; Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front of him. 
  
It would have been a happy, peaceful holiday had it not been for the stones of disappearances, odd accidents, even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the Prophet. Sometimes Bill and Mr. Weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper. To Mrs. Weasleys displeasure, Harry's sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked liberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and patched than ever. 
  
"There have been another couple of dementor attacks," he announced, as Mrs. Weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake. "And they've found Igor Karkaroff's body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had been set over it  well, frankly, I'm surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters; Sirius's brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as I can remember." 
  
"Yes, well," said Mrs. Weasley, frowning, "perhaps we should talk about something diff" 
  
"Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?" asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur. "The man who ran " 
  
" the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?" Harry interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. "He used to give me free ice creams. What's happened to him?" 
  
"Dragged off, by the look of his place." 
  
"Why?" asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly glared at Bill. 
  
"Who knows? He must've upset them somehow. He was a good man, Florean." 
  
"Talking of Diagon Alley," said Mr. Weasley, "looks like Ollivander's gone too." 
  
"The wandmaker?" said Ginny, looking startled. 
  
"That's the one. Shop's empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped." 
  
"But wands  what'll people do for wands?" 
  
"They'll make do with other makers," said Lupin. "But Ollivander was the best, and if the other side have got him it's not so good for us." 
  
The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts. Harry's included a surprise: he had been made Quidditch Captain. 
  
"That gives you equal status with prefects!" cried Hermione happily. "You can use our special bathroom now and everything!" 
  
"Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these," said Ron, examining the badge with glee. "Harry, this is so cool, you're my Captain  if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha. . . ." 
  
"Well, I don't suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now you've got these," sighed Mrs. Weasley, looking down Rons booklist. "We'll go on Saturday as long as your father doesn't have to go into work again. I'm not going there without him." 
  
"Mum, d'you honestly think You-Know-Who's going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?" sniggered Ron. 
  
"Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday, did they?" said Mrs. Weasley, firing up at once. "If you think security's a laughing matter you can stay behind and I'll get your things myself" 
  
"No, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and George's shop!" said Ron hastily. 
  
"Then you just buck up your ideas, young man, before I decide you're too immature to come with us!" said Mrs. Weasley angrily, snatching up her clock, all nine hands of which were still pointing at "mortal peril," and balancing it on top of a pile of just-laundered towels. "And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well!" 
  
Ron turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room. 
  
"Blimey. . . you can't even make a joke round here anymore. . . ." 
  
But Ron was careful not to be flippant about Voldemort over the next few days. Saturday dawned without any more outbursts from Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed very tense at breakfast. Bill, who 
  
would be staying at home with Fleur (much to Hermione and Ginny's pleasure), passed a full money bag across the table to Harry. 
  
"Where's mine?" demanded Ron at once, his eyes wide. 
  
"That's already Harry's, idiot," said Bill. "I got it out of your vault for you, Harry, because it's taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment, the goblins have tightened security so much. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up his ... Well, trust me, this way's easier." 
  
"Thanks, Bill," said Harry, pocketing his gold. 
  
'"E is always so thoughtful," purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back. 
  
It was an overcast, murky day. One of the special Ministry of Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden once before, was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house, pulling on their cloaks. 
  
"It's good Dad can get us these again," said Ron appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window. He, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat. 
  
"Don't get used to it, it's only because of Harry," said Mr. Weasley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley were in front with the Ministry driver; the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a two-seater sofa. "He's been given top-grade security status. And we'll be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too." 
  
Harry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his shopping 
  
while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that, if that was good enough for Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the Ministry, though now he came to think of it, he was not sure the Ministry knew about his cloak. 
  
"Here you are, then," said the driver, a surprisingly short while later, speaking for the first time as he slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside the Leaky Cauldron. "I'm to wait for you, any idea how long you'll be?" 
  
"A couple of hours, I expect," said Mr. Weasley. "Ah, good, he's here!" 
  
Harry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the window; his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harry's face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles. 
  
"Harry!" he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone-crushing hug the moment Harry had stepped out of the car. "Buckbeak  Witherwings, I mean  yeh should see him, Harry, he's so happy ter be back in the open air " 
  
"Glad he's pleased," said Harry, grinning as he massaged his ribs. "We didn't know 'security' meant you!" 
  
"I know, jus' like old times, innit? See, the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o' Aurors, but Dumbledore said I'd do," said Hagrid proudly, throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. "Lets get goin' then  after yeh, Molly, Arthur " 
  
The Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry's memory, completely empty. Only Tom the landlord, wizened and toothless, 
  
remained of the old crowd. He looked up hopefully as they entered, but before he could speak, Hagrid said importantly, "Jus' passin' through today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts business, yeh know." 
  
Tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; Harry, Hermione, Hagrid, and the Weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood. Hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street. They stepped through the entrance and paused, looking around. 
  
Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others bore moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be on the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including those of Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of shabby-looking stalls had sprung up along the street. The nearest one, which had been erected outside Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard sign pinned to its front: 
  
AMULETS 
  
Effective Against Werewolves, -=-Dement on, and -=-infer! 
  
A seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby. 
  
"One for your little girl, madam?" he called at Mrs. Weasley as they passed, leering at Ginny. "Protect her pretty neck?" 
  
"If I were on duty . . ." said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily at the amulet seller. 
  
"Yes, but don't go arresting anyone now, dear, we're in a hurry," said Mrs. Weasley, nervously consulting a list. "I think we'd better do Madam Malkin's first, Hermione wants new dress robes, and Ron's showing much too much ankle in his school robes, and you must need new ones too, Harry, you've grown so much  come on, everyone " 
  
"Molly, it doesn't make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkin's," said Mr. Weasley. "Why don't those three go with Hagrid, and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyone's school-books?" 
  
"I don't know," said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack. "Hagrid, do you think - ?" 
  
"Don' fret, they'll be fine with me, Molly," said Hagrid soothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid. Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for Madam Malkin's. 
  
Harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried, anxious look as Mrs. Weasley, and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups, moving intently about their business. Nobody seemed to be shopping alone. 
  
"Migh' be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us," said Hagrid, stopping outside Madam Malkin's and bending down to peer through the window. "I'll stand guard outside, all right?" 
  
So Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the little shop together. It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue. 
  
". . . not a child, in case you haven't noticed, Mother. I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone." 
  
There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, "Now, dear, your mother's quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore, it's nothing to do with being a child " 
  
"Watch where you're sticking that pin, will you!" 
  
A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white-blond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. He strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a few moments before he noticed Harry, Ron, and Hermione reflected over his shoulder. His light gray eyes narrowed. 
  
"If you're wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just walked in," said Draco Malfoy. 
  
"I don't think there's any need for language like that!" said Madam Malkin, scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand. "And I don't want wands drawn in my shop either!" she added hastily, for a glance toward the door had shown her Harry and Ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at Malfoy. Hermione, who was standing slightly behind them, whispered, "No, don't, honestly, it's not worth it. " 
  
"Yeah, like you'd dare do magic out of school," sneered Malfoy. "Who blacked your eye, Granger? I want to send them flowers." 
  
"That's quite enough!" said Madam Malkin sharply, looking over her shoulder for support. "Madam  please " 
  
Narcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack. 
  
"Put those away," she said coldly to Harry and Ron. "If you at-tack my son again, I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do." 
  
"Really?" said Harry, taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that, for all its pallor, still resembled her sister's. He was as tall as she was now. "Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, are you?" 
  
Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart. 
  
"Really, you shouldn't accuse  dangerous thing to say  wands away, please!" 
  
But Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy smiled unpleasantly. 
  
"I see that being Dumbledore's favorite has given you a false sense of security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore won't always be there to protect you." 
  
Harry looked mockingly all around the shop. "Wow. . . look at that. . . he's not here now! So why not have a go? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!" 
  
Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but stumbled over his overlong robe. Ron laughed loudly. 
  
"Don't you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!" Malfoy snarled. 
  
"It's all right, Draco," said Narcissa, restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder. "I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius." ' 
  
Harry raised his wand higher. 
  
"Harry, no!" moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side. "Think. . . . You mustn't. . . . You'll be in such trouble. ..." 
  
Madam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it wouldn't. She bent toward Malfoy, who was still glaring at Harry. 
  
"I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, dear, let me just " 
  
"Ouch!" bellowed Malfoy, slapping her hand away. "Watch where you're putting your pins, woman! Mother  I don't think I want these anymore " 
  
He pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at Madam Malkin's feet. 
  
"You're right, Draco," said Narcissa, with a contemptuous glance at Hermione, "now I know the kind of scum that shops here. . . . We'll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting's." 
  
And with that, the pair of them strode out of the shop, Malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into Ron on the way out. 
  
"Well, really? said Madam Malkin, snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner, so that it removed all the dust. 
  
She was distracted all through the fitting of Ron's and Harry's new robes, tried to sell Hermione wizard's dress robes instead of witch's, and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them. 
  
"Got ev'rything?" asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side. 
  
"Just about," said Harry. "Did you see the Malfoys?" 
  
"Yeah," said Hagrid, unconcerned. "Bu they wouldn dare make trouble in the middle o' Diagon Alley, Harry. Don' worry abou1 them." 
  
Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged looks, but before they could disabuse Hagrid of this comfortable notion, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny appeared, all clutching heavy packages of books. 
  
"Everyone all right?" said Mrs. Weasley. "Got your robes? Right then, we can pop in at the Apothecary and Eeylops on the way to Fred and George's  stick close, now. . . ." 
  
Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the Apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying Potions, but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium. Then, with Mrs. Weasley checking her watch every minute or so, they headed farther along the street in search of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop run by Fred and George. 
  
"We really haven't got too long," Mrs. Weasley said. "So we'll just have a quick look around and then back to the car. We must be close, that's number ninety-two . . . ninety-four . . ." 
  
"Whoa,"said Ron, stopping in his tracks. 
  
Set against the dull, poster-muffled shop Fronts around them, Fred and Georges windows hit the eye like a firework display. Casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows, and a few rather stunned-looking people had actually come to a halt, transfixed. The left-hand window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, flashed, bounced, and shrieked; Harrys eyes began to water just looking at it. The right-hand window was covered with a gigantic poster, purple like those of the Ministry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters: 
  
WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT 
YOU-KNOW-WHO? 
YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT 
U-NO-POO-- 
THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION 
THAT'S GRIPPING THE NATION! 
  
Harry started to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster. Her lips moved silently, mouthing the name "U-No-Poo." 
  
"They'll be murdered in their beds!" she whispered. 
  
"No they wont!" said Ron, who, like Harry, was laughing. "This is brilliant!" 
  
And he and Harry led the way into the shop. It was packed with customers; Harry could not get near the shelves. He stared around, looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last, unfinished year at Hogwarts; Harry noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one battered box left on the shelf. There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties. A space cleared in the crowd, and Harry pushed his way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, both perched on a box that read: reusable hangman  spell it or he'll swing! 
  
"'Patented Daydream Charms 
  
Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship. 
  
"'One simple incantation and you will enter a top-quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens. You know," said Hermione, looking up at Harry, "that really is extraordinary magic!" 
  
"For that, Hermione," said a voice behind them, "you can have one for free." 
  
A beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair. 
  
"How are you, Harry?" They shook hands. "And what's happened to your eye, Hermione?" 
  
"Your punching telescope," she said ruefully. 
  
"Oh blimey, I forgot about those," said Fred. "Here " 
  
He pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her; she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste. 
  
"Just dab it on, that bruise'll be gone within the hour," said Fred. "We had to find a decent bruise remover. We're testing most of our products on ourselves." 
  
Hermione looked nervous. "It is safe, isn't it?" she asked. 
  
'"Course it is," said Fred bracingly. "Come on, Harry, I'll give you a tour." 
  
Harry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Fred toward the back of the shop, where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks. 
  
"Muggle magic tricks!" said Fred happily, pointing them out. "For freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle stuff. It's not a big earner, but we do fairly steady business, they're great novelties. . . . Oh, here's George. ..." 
  
Fred's twin shook Harrys hand energetically. 
  
"Giving him the tour? Come through the back, Harry, that's where we're making the real moneypocket anything, you, and you'll pay in more than Galleons!" he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled edible dark 
  
MARKS----THEY'LL MAKE ANYONE SICK! 
  
George pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and Harry saw a darker, less crowded room. The packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued. 
  
"We've just developed this more serious line," said Fred. "Funny how it happened . . ." 
  
"You wouldn't believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, can't do a decent Shield Charm," said George. "'Course, they didn't have you teaching them, Harry." 
  
"That's right. . . . Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we're still getting massive orders!" 
  
"So we've expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield Gloves ..." 
  
"... I mean, they wouldn't help much against the Unforgivable Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes . . ." 
  
"And then we thought we'd get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts, because it's such a money spinner," continued George enthusiastically. "This is cool. Look, Instant Darkness Powder, we're importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make 
  
a quick escape." 
  
"And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look," said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. "You just drop one surreptitiously and it'll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need one. 
  
"Handy," said Harry, impressed. 
  
"Here," said George, catching a couple and throwing them to Harry. 
  
A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain; Harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes. 
  
"There's a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley," she said. 
  
Harry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called "Mr. Weasley," but they took it in their stride. 
  
"Right you are, Verity, I'm coming," said George promptly. "Harry, you help yourself to anything you want, all right? No charge." 
  
"I can't do that!" said Harry, who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators. 
  
"You don't pay here," said Fred firmly, waving away Harry's gold. 
  
"But" 
  
"You gave us our start-up loan, we haven't forgotten," said George sternly "Take whatever you like, and just remember to tell people where you got it, if they ask." 
  
George swept off through the curtain to help with the customers, and Fred led Harry back into the main part of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still poring over the Patented Daydream Charms. 
  
"Haven't you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet?" asked Fred. "Follow me, ladies. . . ." 
  
Near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically. Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary. 
  
"There you go," said Fred proudly. "Best range of love potions you'll find anywhere." 
  
Ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically. "Do they work?" she asked. 
  
"Certainly they work, for up to twenty-four hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question " 
  
" and the attractiveness of the girl," said George, reappearing suddenly at their side. "But we're not selling them to our sister," he added, becoming suddenly stern, "not when she's already got about five boys on the go from what we've " 
  
"Whatever you've heard from Ron is a big fat lie," said Ginny calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf. "What's this?" 
  
"Guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher," said Fred. "Excellent on everything from boils to blackheads, but don't change the subject. Are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called Dean Thomas?" 
  
"Yes, I am," said Ginny. "And last time I looked, he was definitely one boy, not five. What are those?" 
  
She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks. 
  
"Pygmy Puffs," said George. "Miniature puffskeins, we cant breed them fast enough. So what about Michael Corner?" 
  
"I dumped him, he was a bad loser," said Ginny, putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. "They're really cute!" 
  
"They're fairly cuddly, yes," conceded Fred. "But you're moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren't you?" 
  
Ginny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. There was such a Mrs. Weasley-ish glare on her face that Harry was surprised Fred didn't recoil. 
  
"It's none of your business. And I'll thank you'' she added angrily to Ron, who had just appeared at George's elbow, laden with merchandise, "not to tell tales about me to these two!" 
  
"That's three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut," said Fred, examining the many boxes in Ron's arms. "Cough up." 
  
"I'm your brother!" 
  
"And that's our stuff you're nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sickles. I'll knock off the Knut." 
  
"But I haven't got three Galleons, nine Sickles!" 
  
"You'd better put it back then, and mind you put it on the right shelves." 
  
Ron dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude hand gesture at Fred that was unfortunately spotted by Mrs. Weasley, who had chosen that moment to appear. 
  
"If I see you do that again I'll jinx your fingers together," she said sharply. 
  
"Mum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?" said Ginny at once. 
  
"A what?" said Mrs. Weasley warily. 
  
"Look, they're so sweet. . . ." 
  
Mrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window. Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street alone. As he passed Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him. 
  
"Wonder where his mummy is?" said Harry, frowning. 
  
"Given her the slip by the looks of it," said Ron. 
  
"Why, though?" said Hermione. 
  
Harry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. Narcissa Malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly; Malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches. 
  
Harry, knowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason could not be innocent. 
  
He glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were bending over the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was delightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked playing cards. Fred and George were both helping customers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was standing with his back to them, looking up and down the street. 
  
"Get under here, quick," said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. 
  
"Oh  I don't know, Harry," said Hermione, looking uncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley. 
  
"Come on\" said Ron. 
  
She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the cloak with Harry and Ron. Nobody noticed them vanish; they were all too interested in Fred and George's products. Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could, but by the time they gained the street, Malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had. 
  
"He was going in that direction," murmured Harry as quietly as possible, so that the humming Hagrid would not hear them. Cmon. 
  
They scurried along, peering left and right, through shop windows and doors, until Hermione pointed ahead. 
  
"That's him, isn't it?" she whispered. "Turning left?" 
  
"Big surprise," whispered Ron. 
  
For Malfoy had glanced around, then slid into Knockturn Alley and out of sight. 
  
"Quick, or we'll lose him," said Harry, speeding up. 
  
"Our feet'Il be seen!" said Hermionc anxiously, as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles; it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays. 
  
"It doesn't matter," said Harry impatiently. "Just hurry!" 
  
But Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the Dark Arts, looked completely deserted. They peered into windows as they passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all. Harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts  or at least, to be seen buying them. 
  
Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch. 
  
"Ouch!" 
  
"Shh! Look! He's in there!" she breathed in Harry's ear. 
  
They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that Harry had ever visited, Borgin and Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister objects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to them, just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which Harry had once hidden to avoid Malfoy and his father. Judging by the movements of Malfoy's hands, he was talking animatedly. The proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oily-haired, stooping man, stood facing Malfoy. He was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear. 
  
"If only we could hear what they're saying!" said Hermione. 
  
"We can!" said Ron excitedly. "Hang on  damn " 
  
He dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest. 
  
"Extendable Ears, look!" 
  
"Fantastic!" said Hermione, as Ron unraveled the long, flesh- 
  
colored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door. "Oh, I hope the door isn't Imperturbable " 
  
"No!" said Ron gleefully. "Listen!" 
  
They put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings, through which Malfoy's voice could be heard loud and clear, as though a radio had been turned on. 
  
". . . you know how to fix it?" 
  
"Possibly," said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself. "I'll need to see it, though. Why don't you bring it into the shop?" 
  
"I can't," said Malfoy. "It's got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to do it." 
  
Harry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously. 
  
"Well, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job, perhaps impossible. I couldn't guarantee anything." 
  
"No?" said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, that Malfoy was sneering. "Perhaps this will make you more confident." 
  
He moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened. 
  
"Tell anyone," said Maifoy, "and there will be retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? He's a family friend. He'll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you're giving the problem your full attention." 
  
"There will be no need for " 
  
"I'll decide that," said Malfoy. "Well, I'd better be off. And don't forget to keep that one safe, I'll need it." 
  
"Perhaps you'd like to take it now?" 
  
"No, of course I wouldn't, you stupid, little man, how would I look carrying that down the street? Just don't sell it." 
  
"Of course not. . . sir." 
  
Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him give Lucius Malfoy. 
  
"Not a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my mother, understand?" 
  
"Naturally, naturally," murmured Borgin, bowing again. 
  
Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself. He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried. 
  
"What was that about?" whispered Ron, reeling in the Extendable Ears. 
  
"Dunno," said Harry, thinking hard. "He wants something mended . . . and he wants to reserve something in there. . . . Could you see what he pointed at when he said 'that one'?" 
  
"No, he was behind that cabinet " 
  
"You two stay here," whispered Hermione. 
  
"What are you  ?" 
  
But Hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak. She checked her hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to Harry. 
  
"Hello, horrible morning, isn't it?" Hermione said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display. 
  
"Is this necklace for sale?" she asked, pausing beside a glass-fronted case. 
  
"If you've got one and a half thousand Galleons," said Mr. 
  
Borgin coldly. 
  
"Oh  er  no, I haven't got quite that much," said Hermione, walking on. "And . . . what about this lovely  um  skull?" 
  
"Sixteen Galleons." 
  
"So it's for sale, then? It isn't being . . . kept for anyone?" 
  
Mr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to. Apparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the 
  
winds. 
  
"The thing is, that  er  boy who was in here just now, Draco Malfoy, well, he's a friend of mine, and I want to get him a birthday present, but if he's already reserved anything, I obviously don't want to get him the same thing, so ... um ..." 
  
It was a pretty lame story in Harry's opinion, and apparently Borgin thought so too. 
  
"Out," he said sharply. "Get out!" 
  
Hermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell tinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign. 
  
"Ah well," said Ron, throwing the cloak back over Hermione. "Worth a try, but you were a bit obvious " 
  
"Well, next time you can show me how it's done, Master of Mystery!" she snapped. 
  
Ron and Hermione bickered all the way back to Weasleys' 
  
Wizard Wheezes, where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxious-looking Mrs. Weasley and Hagrid, who had clearly noticed their absence. Once in the shop, Harry whipped off the Invisibility Cloak, hid it in his bag, and joined in with the other two when they insisted, in answer to Mrs. Weasleys accusations, that they had been in the back room all along, and that she could not have looked properly. 
  
  

Chapter 7: The Slug Club


Harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoy's behavior in Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoy's face as he had left the shop. Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoy's activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days.
"Yes, I've already agreed it was fishy, Harry," said Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and George's room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation. "But haven't we agreed there could be a lot of explanations?"
"Maybe he's broken his Hand of Glory" said Ron vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his broomstick's bent tail twigs. "Remember that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?"
"But what about when he said, 'Don't forget to keep that one safe'?" asked Harry for the umpteenth time. "That sounded to me like Borgin's got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both."
"You reckon?" said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle.
"Yeah, I do," said Harry. When neither Ron nor Hermione answered, he said, "Malfoy's father's in Azkaban. Don't you think Malfoyd like revenge?"
Ron looked up, blinking.
"Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?"
"That's my point, I don't know!" said Harry, frustrated. "But he's up to something and I think we should take it seriously. His father's a Death Eater and ?quot;
Harry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione, his mouth open. A startling thought had just occurred to him.
"Harry?" said Hermione in an anxious voice. "What's wrong?"
"Your scar's not hurting again, is it?" asked Ron nervously.
"He's a Death Eater," said Harry slowly. "He's replaced his father as a Death Eater!"
There was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. "Malfoy? He's sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join?"
"It seems very unlikely, Harry," said Hermione in a repressive sort of voice. "What makes you think ??"
"In Madam Malkin's. She didn't touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He's been branded with the Dark Mark."
Ron and Hermione looked at each other.
"Well.. ." said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced.
"I think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry," said Hermione.
"He showed Borgin something we couldn't see," Harry pressed on stubbornly. "Something that seriously scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know it ?he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw how seriously Borgin took him!"
Ron and Hermione exchanged another look.
"I'm not sure, Harry. . . ."
"Yeah, I still don't reckon You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join.. . ."
Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Harry snatched up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and left the room; Mrs. Weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment. On the landing he bumped into Ginny, who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes.
"I wouldn't go in the kitchen just now," she warned him. "There's a lot of Phlegm around."
"I'll be careful not to slip in it." Harry smiled.
Sure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow about plans for her wedding to Bill, while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling sprouts, looking bad-tempered.
". . . Bill and I 'ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer. I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold ?pink would of course be 'orrible with Ginny's 'air ?quot;
"Ah, Harry!" said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across Fleur's monologue. "Good, I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow. We've got Ministry cars again, and there will be Aurors waiting at the station ?quot;
"Is Tonks going to be there?" asked Harry, handing over his Quidditch things.
"No, I don't think so, she's been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said."
"She has let 'erself go, zat Tonks," Fleur mused, examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon. "A big mistake if you ask?quot;
"Yes, thank you," said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting across Fleur again. "You'd better get on, Harry, I want the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we don't have the usual last-minute scramble."
And in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron's owl, Pig-widgeon; and Ginny's new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.
"Au revoir, 'Any," said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur's feet. Furious, red-faced, and dirt-spattered, he hurried into the car without saying good-bye.
There was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at King's Cross Station. Instead, two grim-faced, bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, marched them into the station without speaking.
"Quick, quick, through the barrier," said Mrs. Weasley, who
seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency. "Harry had better go first, with ?quot;
She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly, seized Harry's upper arm, and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten.
"I can walk, thanks," said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of the Auror's grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later, standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd.
Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-faced Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform, looking for an empty compartment.
"We can't, Harry," said Hermione, looking apologetic. "Ron and I've got to go to the prefects' carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit."
"Oh yeah, I forgot," said Harry.
"You'd better get straight on the train, all of you, you've only got a few minutes to go," said Mrs. Weasley, consulting her watch. "Well, have a lovely term, Ron. . . ."
"Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?" said Harry, making up his mind on the spur of the moment.
"Of course," said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless.
Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations, and secondly,
because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger.
He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away.
"When we were in Diagon Alley," Harry began, but Mr. Weasley forestalled him with a grimace.
"Am I about to discover where you, Ron, and Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and George's shop?"
"How did you ??"
"Harry, please. You're talking to the man who raised Fred and George."
"Er . . . yeah, all right, we weren't in the back room." "Very well, then, let's hear the worst."
"Well, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my Invisibility Cloak."
"Did you have any particular reason for doing so, or was it a mere whim?"
"Because I thought Malfoy was up to something," said Harry, disregarding Mr. Weasley's look of mingled exasperation and amusement. "He'd given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why."
"Of course you did," said Mr. Weasley, sounding resigned. "Well? Did you find out why?"
"He went into Borgin and Burkes," said Harry, "and started bullying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help him fix something. And he said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him. He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like they were a pair. And ..."
Harry took a deep breath.
"There's something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I think he's been branded with the Dark Mark. 1 think he's replaced his father as a Death Eater."
Mr. Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he said, "Harry, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would allow a sixteen-year-old ?quot;
"Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would or wouldn't do?" asked Harry angrily. "Mr. Weasley, I'm sorry, but isn't it worth investigating? If Malfoy wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, it's probably something Dark or dangerous, isn't it?"
"I doubt it, to be honest, Harry," said Mr. Weasley slowly. "You see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, we raided his house. We took away everything that might have been dangerous." "I think you missed something," said Harry stubbornly. "Well, maybe," said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr. Weasley was humoring him.
There was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing.
"You'd better hurry!' said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. Weasley cried, "Harry, quickly!"
He hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train.
"Now, dear, you're coming to us for Christmas, it's all fixed with Dumbledore, so we'll see you quite soon," said Mrs. Weasley through the window, as Harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move. "You make sure you look after yourself and ?quot;
The train was gathering speed.
"?be good and ?quot; , She was jogging to keep up now.
"?stay safe!"
Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefects' carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her, dragging his trunk.
People stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the "Chosen One" rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder.
"Fancy trying to find a compartment?"
"I can't, Harry, I said I'd meet Dean," said Ginny brightly. "See you later."
"Right," said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked around: He was surrounded by mesmerized girls.
"Hi, Harry!" said a familiar voice from behind him.
"Neville!" said Harry in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy struggling toward him.
"Hello, Harry," said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Neville.
"Luna, hi, how are you?"
"Very well, thank you," said Luna. She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside.
"Quibbler still going strong, then?" asked Harry, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given it an exclusive interview the previous year.
"Oh yes, circulation's well up," said Luna happily.
"Let's find seats," said Harry, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students. At last they found an empty compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully.
"They're even staring at us? said Neville, indicating himself and Luna. "Because we're with you!"
"They're staring at you because you were at the Ministry too," said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. "Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must've
seen it."
"Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity," said Neville, "but she was really pleased. Says I'm starting to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!"
He pulled it out and showed it to Harry.
"Cherry and unicorn hair," he said proudly. "We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day ?oi, come back here, Trevor!"
And he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom.
"Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?" asked Luna,
who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler.
"No point now we've got rid of Umbridge, is there?" said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed.
"I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!"
"I enjoyed the meetings too," said Luna serenely. "It was like having friends."
This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance outside their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass.
"You ask him!"
No, you!
"I'll do it!"
And one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the door.
"Hi, Harry, I'm Romilda, Romilda Vane," she said loudly and confidently. "Why don't you join us in our compartment? You don't have to sit with them," she added in a stage whisper, indicating Neville's bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl.
"They're friends of mine," said Harry coldly.
"Oh," said the girl, looking very surprised. "Oh. Okay."
And she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her.
"People expect you 10 have cooler friends than us," said Luna, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty.
"You are cool," said Harry shortly. "None of them was at the Ministry. They didn't fight with me."
"That's a very nice thing to say," beamed Luna. Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The
Quibbler.
"We didn't face him, though," said Neville, emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resigned-looking Trevor in his hand. "You did. You should hear my gran talk about you. 'That Harry Potter's got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together!' She'd give anything to have you as a grand-son. . . .
Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to OWL. results as soon as he could. While Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration NEWT, with only an "Acceptable," Harry watched him without really listening.
Neville's childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as much as Harry's had, but Neville had no idea how close he had come to having Harry's destiny. The prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant.
Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy. ... Or would it? Would Nevilles mother have died to save him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she would. . . . But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort? Would there then have been no "Chosen One" at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good-bye by his own mother, not Ron's?
"You all right, Harry? You look funny," said Neville.
Harry started. "Sorry ?I ?quot;
"Wrackspurt got you?" asked Luna sympathetically, peering at Harry through her enormous colored spectacles.
"I what?"
"A Wrackspurt. . . They're invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy," she said. "I thought I felt one zooming around in here."
She flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught each other's eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.
The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at last.
"Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I'm starving," said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside Harry and rubbing his stomach. "Hi, Neville. Hi, Luna. Guess what?" he added, turning to Harry. "Malfoy s not doing prefect duty. He's just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed."
Harry sat up straight, interested. It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the previous year.
"What did he do when he saw you?"
"The usual," said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand
gesture. "Not like him, though, is it? Well ?that is" ?he did the hand gesture again ?"but why isn't he out there bullying first years?
"Dunno," said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn't this look as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students?
"Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad," said Hermione. "Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that."
"I don't think so," said Harry. "I think he's ?quot;
But before he could expound on his theory, the compartment door slid open again and a breathless third-year girl stepped inside.
"I'm supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry P-Potter," she faltered, as her eyes met Harry's and she turned scarlet. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.
"What is it?" Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his.
"An invitation," said Harry.?/p> 
Harry,
I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C.
Sincerely, . , .
"But what does he want me for?" asked Neville nervously, as though he was expecting detention.
"No idea," said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. "Listen," he added, seized by a sudden brain wave, "let's go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what he's up to."
This idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on.
When they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughorn's only invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn's welcome, Harry was the most warmly anticipated.
"Harry, m'boy!" said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden
buttons on his waistcoat. "Good to see you, good to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!"
Neville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. Harry glanced around at their fellow guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ginny.
"Now, do you know everyone?" Slughorn asked Harry and Neville. "Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course -?"
Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.
"This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you've come across each other ?? No?"
McLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Harry and Neville nodded back at him.
"?and this is Marcus Belby, I don't know whether ??"
Belby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a strained smile.
"?and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!" Slughorn finished.
Ginny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorn's back.
"Well now, this is most pleasant," said Slughorn cozily. "A chance to get to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin. I've packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on
licorice wands, and a poor old man's digestive system isn't quite up to such things. . . . Pheasant, Belby?"
Belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant.
"I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles," Slughorn told Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket of rolls. "Outstanding wizard, outstanding, and his Order of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see much of your uncle, Marcus?"
Unfortunately, Beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to choke.
"Anapneo," said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once.
"Not. . . not much of him, no," gasped Belby, his eyes streaming.
"Well, of course, I daresay he's busy," said Slughorn, looking questioningly at Belby. "I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work!"
"I suppose . . ." said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with him. "Er ... he and my dad don't get on very well, you see, so I don't really know much about..."
His voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to McLaggen instead.
"Now, you, Cormac," said Slughorn, "I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?"
"Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was," said McLaggen. "We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour ?this was before he became Minister, obviously ?quot;
"Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus too?" beamed Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed out. "Now tell me . . ."
It was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody well-known or influential ?everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold). It was Neville's turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville's parents, well-known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies. At the end of Neville's interview, Harry had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his parents' flair.
"And now," said Slughorn, shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act. "Harry Potter! Where to begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer!" He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant, then said, "'The Chosen One,' they're calling you now!"
Harry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all staring at him.
"Of course," said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, "there have been rumors for years. ... I remember when ?well ?after that terrible night ?Lily ?James ?and you survived ?and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary ?quot;
Zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to
indicate amused skepticism. An angry voice burst out from behind Slughorn.
"Yeah, Zabini, because you're so talented ... at posing. . . ."
"Oh dear!" chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking around at Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini around Slughorn's great belly. "You want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldn't cross her!"
Zabini merely looked contemptuous.
"Anyway," said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. "Such rumors this summer. Of course, one doesn't know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes ?but there seems little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all!"
Harry, who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying, nodded but still said nothing. Slughorn beamed at him.
"So modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so fond ?you were there, then? But the rest of the stories ?so sensational, of course, one doesn't know quite what to believe ?this fabled prophecy, for instance ?quot;
"We never heard a prophecy," said Neville, turning geranium pink as he said it.
"That's right," said Ginny staunchly. "Neville and I were both there too, and all this 'Chosen One' rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual."
"You were both there too, were you?" said Slughorn with great interest, looking from Ginny to Neville, but both of them sat clam-like before his encouraging smile.
"Yes. . . well... it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates, of course. . . ." Slughorn said, sounding a little disappointed. "I remember dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies) ?quot;
He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with him, and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny.
The afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the "Slug Club" at Hogwarts. Harry could not wait to leave, but couldn't see how to do so politely. Finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in the twilight.
"Good gracious, it's getting dark already! I didn't notice that they'd lit the lamps! You'd better go and change into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. Harry, Blaise ?any time you're passing. Same goes for you, miss," he twinkled at Ginny. "Well, off you go, off you go!"
As he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, Zabini shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with interest. He, Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back along the train.
"I'm glad that's over," muttered Neville. "Strange man, isn't he?" "Yeah, he is a bit," said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. "How come you ended up in there, Ginny?"
"He saw me hex Zacharias Smith," said Ginny. "You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him ?when Slughorn came in I
thought I was going to got detention, but he just thought it was ;i really good hex and invited me to lunch! Mad, eh?"
"Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother's famous," said Harry, scowling at the back of Zabini's head, "or because their uncle ?quot;
But he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a reckless but potentially wonderful idea. ... In a minute's time, Zabini was going to reenter the Slytherin sixth-year compartment and Malfoy would be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Slytherins. ... If Harry could only enter, unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? True, there was little of the journey left ?Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows ?but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harry's suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to prove them.
"I'll see you two later," said Harry under his breath, pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself.
"But what're you ??" asked Neville.
"Later!" whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless.
The corridors were almost completely empty now. Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the door. Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing.
"What's wrong with this thing?" said Zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry's foot.
Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyle's lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabini's temporarily empty seat, and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoy's eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinsons lap. Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy's forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbe's comic directly
below him.
"So, Zabini," said Malfoy, "what did Slughorn want?"
"Just trying to make up to well-connected people," said Zabini,
who was still glowering at Goyle. "Not that he managed to find
many."
This information did not seem to please Malfoy. "Who else had he invited?" he demanded.
"McLaggen from Gryffindor," said Zabini.
"Oh yeah, his uncle's big in the Ministry," said Malfoy.
"?someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw ?quot;
"Not him, he's a prat!" said Pansy.
"?and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl," finished Zabini.
Malfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy's hand aside.
"He invited Longbottom?."
"Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there," said Zabini indifferently.
"What's Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?"
Zabini shrugged.
"Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at 'the Chosen One,'" sneered Malfoy, "but that Weasley girl! What's so special about her??/p> 
"A lot of boys like her," said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. "Even you think she's good-looking, don't you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please!
"I wouldn't touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like," said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair.
"Well, I pity Slughorn's taste. Maybe he's going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasn't heard I'm on the train, or ?quot;
"I wouldn't bank on an invitation," said Zabini. "He asked me about Notts father when I first arrived. They used to be old
friends, apparently, but when he heard he'd been caught at the Ministry he didn't look happy, and Nott didn't get an invitation, did he? 1 don't think Slughorn's interested in Dearh Eaters."
Malfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly humorless laugh.
"Well, who cares what he's interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teacher." Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. "I mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year, what's it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not?"
"What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year?" said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming Malfoy at once.
"Well, you never know," said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk. "I might have ?er ?moved on to bigger and better things."
Crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harry's heart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy s hair, looking dumbfounded.
"Do you mean 
Malfoy shrugged.
"Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don't see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it. ... When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many OWLs or N.E.W.T.S anyone's got? Of course he isn't?It'll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown."
"And you think you'll be able to do something for him?" asked
Zabini scathingly. "Sixteen years old and noi even fully qualified yet?"
"I've just said, haven't I? Maybe he doesn't care if I'm qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn't something that you need to be qualified for," said Malfoy quietly.
Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe-inspiring.
"I can see Hogwarts," said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. "We'd better get our robes on."
Harry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.
Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck.
Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out
into a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and Zabini followed.
"You go on," Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. "I just want to check something."
Pansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment. People were filing past, descending onto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.
Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend?
"Petrificus Totalus!"
Without warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy's feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. He couldn't move a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly.
"I thought so," he said jubilantly. "I heard Goyle's trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back. . . ."
His eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry's trainers.
"You didn't hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I've got you here . . ."
-=-Him
And he stamped, hard, on Harry's face. Harry felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere.
"That's from my father. Now, let's see. . . ."
Malfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry's immobilized body and threw it over him.
"I don't reckon they'll find you till the trains back in London," he said quietly. "See you around, Potter ... or not."
And taking care to tread on Harry's fingers, Malfoy left the compartment.

Chapter 8:  Victorious Snape

Harry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the _ Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate thought was that someone, would surely, would check the compartments before the train departed again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him. 
Harry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in... and now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk.
Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to London.
He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words "Accio Wand!" over and over again in his head, but nothing happened.
He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an owl, but no hint of a search being made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson.
The train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it...
Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said, "Wotcher, Harry."
There was a flash of red light and Harry's body unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand, and raise his head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibiliiv Cloak she had just pulled away.
We'd better get out of here, quickly," she said, as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station. "Come on, we'll jump."
Harry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform, which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered a little on landing, then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the corner, and disappear from view.
The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak. 
Who did it?"
Draco Malfoy, said Harry bitterly. "Thanks for... well..." 
No problem, said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as mousy-haired and miserable-lookinng as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. "I can fix your nose if you stand still."
Harry did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he stayed stock-still and closed his eyes, 
Episkey" said Tonks.
Harrys nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand and felt gingerly. It seemed to be mended. 
Thanks a lot!"
You'd better put that cloak back on, and we can walk up to the school," said Tonks, still unsmiling. As Harry swung the cloak back over himself, she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.
''Was that a Patronus?" asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this.
"Yes, I'm sending word to the castle that I've got you or they'll worry. Come on, we'd better not dawdle."
They set off toward the lane that led to the school.
"How did you find me?"
"I noticed you hadn't left the train and I knew you had that cloak. I thought you might be hiding for some reason. When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought Id check."
"But what are you doing here, anyway?" Harry asked. 
"I'm stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra protection," said Tonks.
"Is it just you who's stationed up here, or  ?" 
"No, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too." 
"Dawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?" 
"That's right."
They trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful. Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably that Hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about Sirius to her, that it hadn't been her fault at all, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. He was far from blaming her for Sirius's death; it was no more her fault than anyone elses (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonks's long cloak whispering on the ground behind them.
Having always traveled there by carriage, Harry had never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station. With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind. But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found them chained shut.
Alohomora!" he said confidently, pointing his wand at the padlock, but nothing happened.
That won't work on these," said Tonks. "Dumbledore bewitched them himself."
Harry looked around, I could climb a wall," he suggested.
No, you couldn't," said Tonks flatly. "Anti-intruder jinxes on all of them. Security's been tightened a hundredfold this summer." 
Well then, said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness, I suppose I'll just have to sleep out here and wait for morning.
Someone's coming down for you," said Tonks, "Look." 
A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle. Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filch's wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews. It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them, and had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape.
"Well, well, well," sneered Snape, taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once, so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open. "Nice of you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance."
"I couldn't change, I didn't have my " Harry began, but Snape cut across him.
"There is no need to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite  ah 
 safe in my hands."
"I meant Hagrid to get the message," said Tonks, frowning.
"Hagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like Potter here, so I took it instead. And incidentally," said Snape, standing back to allow Harry to pass him, "I was interested to see your new Patronus."
He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again, so that they slithered, clinking, back into place.
"I think you were better off with the old one," said Snape, the malice in his voice unmistakable. "The new one looks weak."
As Snape swung the lantern about, Harry saw, fleetingly, a look of shock and anger on Tonks's face. Then she was covered in darkness once more.
"Good night," Harry called to her over his shoulder, as he began the walk up to the school with Snape. "Thanks for ... everything,"
"See you, Harry."
Snape did not speak for a minute or so. Harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredibie that Snape could not feel them burning him. He had loathed Snape from their first encounter, but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry's forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius. Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Snape's snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness. 
Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think," said Snape. And, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire. You know, I dont believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in the term: We haven't even started pudding. You might have set a record, Potter."
The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been immobilized all the way
back to London than tell Snape why he was late.
I suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did you?" Snape
continued. "And with no flying car available you decided that
bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to
create a dramatic effect."
Still Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might
explode. He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for
the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without
anyone else listening.
They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hail. Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. As though he had read Harry's mind, however, Snape said, "No cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees you, which is what you wanted, I'm sure."
Harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors: anything to get away from Snape. The Great Hall with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room, was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow. It was ail a shimmering blur to Harry, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare, and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him, he had spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches toward them, .mil forced his way in between them.
"Where've you  blimey, what've you done to your face?" said Ron, goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity. I
"Why, what's wrong with it?" said Harry, grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection.
"You're covered in blood!" said Hermione. "Come here "
She raised her wand, said "Tergeo!" and siphoned off the dried blood.
"Thanks," said Harry, feeling his now clean face. "How's my nose looking?
Normal," said Hermoine anxiously. "Why shouldn't it? Harry, what happened? We've been terrified!"
I'll tell you later," said Harry curtly. He was very conscious that Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop.
But " said Hermione.
Not now, Hermione," said Harry, in a darkly significant voice. He hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a dementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story as wide as he could, but there was always a chance it wouldn't reach too many Gryffindor ears.
He reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful chips, but before he could take them they vanished, to be replaced with puddings.
You missed the Sorting, anyway," said Hermione, as Ron dived a largt: chocolate gateau. 
Hat say anything interesting?" asked Harry, taking a piece of treacle tart.
More of the same, really . . . advising us all to unite in the face enemies, you know." 
Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?" Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the the feast doesn't he? It can't be long now." 
Snape said Hagrid was late for the feast " 
You've seen Snape? How come?" said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau.
"Bumped into him," said Harry evasively.
"Hagrid was only a few minutes late," said Hermione. "Look, he's waving at you, Harry."
Harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at Hagrid, who was indeed waving at him. Hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagrid's elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side, and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. Harry was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on Hagrid's other side; she rarely left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the start-of-term feast before. She looked as odd as ever, glittering with beads and trailing shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having always considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harry's parents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge made him even less eager to find himself in her company, thankfully, this year he would be dropping Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away toward the Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause. Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, his insides burning again. What he would give to fight Malfoy one-on-one...
"So what did Professor Slughorn want?" Hermione asked.
"To know what really happened at the Ministry." said Harry.
"Him and everyone else here," sniffed Hermione. "People were interrogating us about it on the train, weren't they, Ron?"
"Yeah," said Ron. "All wanting to know if you really are 'the Chosen One' "
"There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts," interrupted Nearly Headless Nick, inclining his barely connected head toward Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff. "I am considered something of a Potter authority; it is widely known that we are friendly. I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information, however. 'Harry Potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence,' I told them. 'I would rather die than betray his trust.'" 
That's nor saying much, seeing as you're already dead," Ron observed.
Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe," said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly.
"The very best of evenings to you!" he said, smiling broadly, his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room. 
What happened to his hand?" gasped Hermione.
She was not the only one who had noticed. Dumbledore's right hand was as blackened and dead-looking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys. Whispers it the room; Dumbledore, interpreting them correctly, merely smiled and shook his purple-and-gold sleeve over his injury. 
Nothing to worry about," he said airily. "Now ... to our new students, welcome, to our old students, welcome back! Another year full of magical education awaits you . .." 
"His hand was like that when I saw him over the summer,"
Harry whispered to Hermione. "I thought he'd have cured it by now, though ... or Madam Pomfrey would've done."
"It looks as if it's died," said Hermione, with a nauseated expression. "But there are some injuries you can't cure... old cursesand there are poisons without antidotes. . . ."
". . . and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say chat there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.
"Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give their names to their Heads of House as usual. We are also looking for new Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.
"We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year, Professor Slughorn" Slughorn stood up, his bald head gleaming in the candlelight, his big waistcoated belly casting the table into shadow  "is a former colleague of mine who has agreed resume his old post of Potions master."
"Potions?"
"Potions?"
The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered wheel they had heard right.
"Potions?" said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare Harry. "But you said "
"Professor Snape, meanwhile," said Dumbledore, raising voice so that it carried over all the muttering, "will be taking the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher."
"No!" said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He did not care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn't it been widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it? 
But Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!" said Hermione. 
"I thought he was!" said Harry, racking his brains to remember when Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to think of it, he was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be teaching.
Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledore's right, did not stand up his mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table, yet Harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much.
Well, there's one good thing," he said savagely. "Snape'll be gone by the end of the year." 
What do you mean?" asked Ron.
That job's jinxed. No ones lasted more than a year. . . . Quirrell actually died doing it. . . . Personally, I'm going to keep my fingers crossed for another death. . . ."
Harry!" said Hermione, shocked and reproachful. 
He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year" said Ron reasonably. "That Slughorn bloke might not want to stay long-term. Moody didn't."
Dumbledore cleared his throat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were not the only ones who had been talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that Snape had finally achieved his hearts desire. Seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted, Dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments, but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing.
"Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength."
The silence seemed to tauten and strain as Dumbledore spoke. Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy was not looking at Dumbledore, but making his fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he found the headmaster's words unworthy of his attention.
"I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is, and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe. The castles magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new and more powerful ways, but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff. I urge you, therefore, to abide by any security restrictions that you teachers might impose upon you, however irksome you might find them  in particular, the rule that you are not to be out of after hours. I implore you, should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle, to report it to a member of staff immediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, always, with the utmost regard for your own and others' safety."
Dumbledore's blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more.
"But now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish, and I know that your top priority is to be well-rested for your lessons tomorrow. Let us therefore say good night. Pip pip!"
With the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the Great Hall toward their dormitories. Harry, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to Malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping, lagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his trainer, allowing most of Gryffindors to draw ahead of him. Hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her prefect's duty of shepherding the first years, but Ron remained with Harry.
What really happened to your nose?" he asked, once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the Hall, and out of earshot of anyone else.
Harry told him. It was a mark of the strength of their friendship that Ron did not laugh.
I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose," he said darkly.
Yeah, well, never mind that," said Harry bitterly. "Listen to what he was saying before he found out I was there . . . ." 
Harry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoys boasts. With what Harry considered pure pigheadedness, however, Ron was unimpressed.
Come on, Harry, he was just showing off for Parkinson.
What kind of mission would You-Know-Who have given him?"
How d'you know Voldemort doesn't need someone at Hogwarts? It wouldn't be the first "
I wish yeh'd stop sayin' tha name, Harry," said a reproachful voice behind them. Harry looked over his shoulder to see Hagtid shaking his head.
"Dumbledore uses that name," said Harry stubbornly
Yeah, well, tha's Dumbledore, innit?" said Hagrid mysteriously.
So how come yeh were late, Harry? I was worried."
"Got held up on the train," said Harry. "Why were you late?"
"I was with Grawp," said Hagrid happily. "Los' track o' the time. He's got a new home up in the mountains now, Dumbledore fixed it  nice big cave. He's much happier than he was in the forest. We were havin' a good chat."
"Really?" said Harry, taking care not to catch Ron's eye; the last time he had met Hagrid's half-brother, a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots, his vocabulary had comprised five words, two of which he was unable to pronounce properly.
"Oh yeah, he's really come on," said Hagrid proudly. "Yeh'll be amazed. I'm thinkin' o' trainin' him up as me assistant."
Ron snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze. They were now standing beside the oak front doors.
"Anyway, I'll see yeh tomorrow, firs' lesson's straight after lunch. Come early an' yeh can say hello ter Buck  I mean, Witherwings!
Raising an arm in cheery farewell, he headed out of the doors into the darkness.
Harry and Ron looked at each other. Harry could tell that Ku| was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself.
"You're not taking Care of Magical Creatures, are you?"
Ron shook his head. "And you're not either, are you?"
Harry shook his head too.
"And Hermione," said Ron, "she's not, is she?"
Harry shook his head again. Exactly what Hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite students had given up his subject, he did not like to think. 
  

Chapter 9: The Half-Blood Prince


Harry and Ron met Hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning. Hoping for some support in his theory, Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on the Hogwarts Express. 
"But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasn't he?" interjected Ron quickly, before Hermione could say anything. 
"Well," she said uncertainly, "I don't know. ... It would be like Malfoy make himself seem more important than he is ... but that's a big lie to tell. . . ."
"Exactly," said Harry, but he could nor press the point, because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands. 
"It's rude to point," Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Harry behind his hand to his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered. "I love being a sixth year. And were going to be getting free time this year. Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax."
"We're going to need that time for studying, Ron!" said Hermione, as they set off down the corridor.
"Yeah, but not today," said Ron. "Today's going to be a real doss, I reckon."
"Hold it!" said Hermione, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand. "Fanged Frisbees banned, hand it over," she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and took off after his friends. Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Hermione's grip. 
"Excellent, I've always wanted one of these." 
Hermione's remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found Ron's remark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over her shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself.
The ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embarassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening.
"But he can't really think we'd continue Care of Magical Creatures !" she said, looking distressed. "I mean, when has any of us expressed . . . you know . . . any enthusiasm?"
"That's it, though, innit?" said Ron, swallowing an entire fried egg whole. "We were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid. But he thinks we liked the stupid subject. D'ya reckon anyone's going to go on to N.E.W.T.?" 
Neither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no need. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Hagrid's eye and returned his cheery wave only half-heartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later.
After they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting Professor McGonagall's descent from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year, for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s.
Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first period Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his O.W.L results.
"Herbology, fine," she said. "Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with 'Exceeds Expectations.' But the problem is Transfiguration. I'm sorry, Longbottom, but an 'Acceptable' really isn't good enough to continue to N.E.W.T. level. Just don't think you'd be able to cope with the coursework." 
Neville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered at him through her square spectacles.
"Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway? I've never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it."
Neville looked miserable and muttered something about "my grandmother wants."
"Hmph," snorted Professot McGonagall. "It's high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she's got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have - particularly after what happened at the Ministry."
Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor McGonagall had never paid him a compliment before.
"I'm sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an 'Exceeds Expectations' in Charm however - why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?"
"My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option," mumbled Neville.
"Take Charms," said Professor McGonagall, "and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless." Smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on Neville's face, Professor McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Neville.
Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, whose first question was whether Firenze, the handsome centaur, was still teaching Divination.
"He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year," said Professor McGonagall, a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination. "The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney."
Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen.
"So, Potter, Potter . . ." said Professor McGonagall, consulting her notes as she turned to Harry. "Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration ... all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven't you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?"
"It was, but you told me I had to get an 'Outstanding' in my O.W.L., Professor."
"And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with 'Exceeds Expectations' at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions?"
"Yes," said Harry, "but I didn't buy the books or any ingredients or anything-"
"I'm sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some," said Professor McGonagall. "Very well, Potter, here is your schedule. Oh, by the way- twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure."
A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Harry, and the two of them left the table together. 
"Look," said Ron delightedly, gazing ar his schedule, "we've got a free period now. . . and a free period after break . . . and after lunch . . . excellent."
They returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in his first year.
"I thought you'd get that, well done," she called over, pointing. at the Captains badge on Harry's chest. "Tell me when you call trials!"
"Don't be stupid," said Harry, "you don't need to try out, I watched you play for five years. . . ."
"You mustn't start off like that," she said warningly. "For all you know, there's someone much better than me out there. Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, or letting in their friends. ..."
Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the fourth-year student. It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanks's yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close.
An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below. Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and looking put-upon.
"We got so much homework for Runes," she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her. "A fifteen-inch essay, two translations, and I've got to read these by Wednesday!"
"Shame," yawned Ron. 
"You wait," she said resentfully. "I bet Snape gives us loads." 
The classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately.
"Inside," he said.
Harry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.
"I have not asked you to take out your books," said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair. "I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention."
His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry's than anyone else's. 
"You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe." 
You believe . . . like you haven't watched them all come and go, hoping you'd be next, thought Harry scathingly. 
Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.WL. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be more advanced."
Snape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view. The Dark Arts," said Snape, "are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible."
Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the
Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?
"Your defenses," said Snape, a little louder, "must therefore be as flexible and inventive as rhe arts you seek to undo. These pictures - he indicated a few of them as he swept past - "give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse" - he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony - "feel the Dementor's Kiss" - a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall - "or provoke the aggression of the Inferius" - a bloody mass upon ground.
"Has an Inferius been seen, then?" said Parvati Patil in a high pitched voice. "Is it definite, is he using them?"
"The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past," said Snape, "which means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. Now. . . " 
He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind him. ,
". . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?"
Hermione's hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, "Very well - Miss Granger?"
"Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you're about to perform," said Hermione, "which gives you a split-second advantage."
"An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six," said Snape dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), "but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some" -
his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more - "lack." 
Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away. 
"You will now divide," Snape went on, "into pairs. One partner will attempt jinx the other without speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on."
Although Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville's muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He
swept between them as they practiced, looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the task.
Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting
on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.
"Pathetic, Weasley," said Snape, after a while. "Here -- let me show you -"
He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, "Protego!"
His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.
"Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?"
"Yes," said Harry stiffly.
"Yes, sir."
"There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor." The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione. Behind Snape, however , Ron, Dean, and Seam us grinned appreciatively.
"Detention, Saturday night, my office," said Snape. "I do not take cheek from anyone, Potter . . . not even 'the Chosen One.'" 
"That was brilliant, Harry!" chortled Ron, once they were safely on their way to break a short while later.
"You really shouldn't have said it," said Hermione, frowning at Ron. "What made you?"
"He tried to jinx me, in case you didn't notice!" fumed Harry. I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons! Why doesn't he use another guinea pig for a change? What's Dumbledore playing at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, tndestructble stuff --
"Well," said Hermione, "I thought he sounded a bit like you."
"Like me?"
"Yes, when you were telling us what it's like to face Voldemort. You said it wasn't just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts - well, wasn't that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking?"
Harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not argue.
"Harry! Hey, Harry!"
Harry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last year's Gryffindor Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment.
"For you," panted Sloper. "Listen, 1 heard you're the new Captain. When're you holding trials?"
"I'm not sure yet," said Harry, thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. "I'll let you know." 
"Oh, right. I was hoping it'd be this weekend -"
"But Harry was not listening; he had just recognized the thin, slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with Ron and Hermione, unrolling the parchment as he went.
Dear Harry,
I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school.
Yours sincerely,
Albus Dumbledore
P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.
"He enjoys Acid Pops?" said Ron, who had read the message over Harry's shoulder and was looking perplexed.
"It's the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study," said Harry in a low voice. "Ha! Snape's not going to be pleased. . . . I won't be able to do his detention!"
He, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started Snape's homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon's double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snape's.
When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner.
"Harry," Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry approached, "didn't get a chance to speak in Defense Against The Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are you, Ron -- Hermione?" 
Before they could say more than "fine," the dungeon door opened and Slughorn's belly preceded him out of the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm.
The dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table together, as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion's fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who grinned back lazily.
"Now then, now then, now then," said Slughorn, whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors. "Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don't forget your copies
of Advanced Potion-Making. . . ."
"Sir?" said Harry, raising his hand.
"Harry, m'boy?"
"I haven't got a book or scales or anything - nor's Ron - we didn't realize we'd be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see -"
"Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention . . . not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I'm sure we can lend you some scales, and we've got a small stock of old books here, they'll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts. . . ."
Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a moment's foraging, emerged with two very battered-looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales.
"Now then," said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, "I've prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of 'em, even if you haven't made 'em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?" 
He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it.
Hermione's well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else's; Slughorn pointed at her.
"It's Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion thar forces the, drinker to tell the truth," said Hermione.
"Very good, very good!" said Slughorn happily. "Now," he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, "this one here is pretty well known. . . . Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too . . . Who can - ?"
Hermione's hand was fastest once more.
"lt's Polyjuice Potion, sir," she said.
Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year. "Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?" said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione's hand punched the air again. 
"It's Amortentia!"
"It is indeed. Ir seems almost foolish to ask," said Slughorn, who was looking mightily impressed, "but I assume you know what it does?" 
It's the most powerful love porion in the world!" said Hermione. 
'Quire right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?"
"And the steam rising in characteristic spirals," said Hermione enthusiastically, "and it's supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and -" 
But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence. 
'May I ask your name, my dear?" said Slughorn, ignoring Hermione's embarrassment.
Hermione Granger, sir."
"Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?"
"No. I don't think so, sir. I'm Muggle-born, you see." 
Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
"Oho! 'One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she's the best in our year!' I'm assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?"
"Yes, sir," said Harry.
"Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger," said Slughorn genially. 
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and whispered, "Did you really tell him I'm the best in the year? Oh, Harry!" 
"Well, what's so impressive about that?" whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. "You are the best in the year - I'd've told him so if he'd asked me!"
Hermione smiled but made a "shhing" gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.
"Amortentia doesn't really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room - oh yes," he said, nodding gravely at Maifoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically. "When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love. ... 

"And now," said Slughorn, "it is time for us to start work."
"Sir, you haven't told us what's in this one," said Ernie Macmillan , pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn's desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled.
"Oho," said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. "Yes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it," he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an audible gasp, "that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?"
"It's liquid luck," said Hermione excitedly. "It makes you lucky!"
The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention.
"Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it's a funny little potion, Felix Felicis," said Slughorn. "Desperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off." 
"Why don't people drink it all the time, sir?" said Terry Boot eagerly.
"Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence," said Slughorn. "Too much of a good thing, you know. . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken
sparingly, and very occasionally . . ."
"Have you ever taken it, sir?" asked Michael Corner with great interest.
"Twice in my life," said Slughorn. "Once when I was twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days."
He gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was playacting or not, thought Harry, the effect was good.
"And that," said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, "is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson."
There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold.
"One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis," said Slughorn, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all. "Enough for twelve hours' luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in everything you attempt."
"Now, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions . . . sporting events, for instance, examinations, or elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary!"
"So," said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, "how are you to win fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go!"
There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making., It could not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him.
To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting up Valerian roots as fast as he could.
Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing; this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten minutes, the
whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed to have progressed furthest. Her potion already resembled the "smooth, black currant-colored liquid" mentioned as the ideal halfway stage.
Having finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low over his book again. It was really very irritating, having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner,
who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction: 
Crush with flat side of silver dagger,
releases juice better than cutting.
"Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?" Harry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table.
"Yes," said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, "I was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasn't unexpected, dragon pox at his age. . . ."
And he walked away. Harry bent back over his cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as though Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis.
The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up. Harry turned to Hermione.
"Can I borrow your silver knife?"
She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, which was still deep purple, though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now.
Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all. 
Hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook.
His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. According the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice?
Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned pale pink.
"How are you doing that?" demanded Hermione, who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple. 
"Add a clockwise stir -"
"No, no, the book says counterclockwise!" she snapped. 
Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterdockwise, one clockwise, pause . . . seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise . . .
Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else's potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon.
"And time's . . . up!" called Slughorn. "Stop stirring, please!" 
Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron's cauldron. He passed over Ernie's navy concoction. Hermione's potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw Harry's, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.
"The clear winner!" he cried to the dungeon. "Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it's clear you've inherited your mother's talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!"
Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherins' faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on Hermione's. Ron looked simply dumbfounded.
"How did you do that?" he whispered to Harry as they left the dungeon.
"Got lucky, I suppose," said Harry, because Malfoy was within earshot.
Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them. Hermione's face became stonier with every word he uttered.
"I s'pose you think I cheated?" he finished, aggravated by her expression.
"Well, it wasn't exactly your own work, was it?" she said stiffly.
"He only followed different instructions to ours," said Ron, "Could've been a catastrophe, couldn't it? But he took a risk and it paid off." He heaved a sigh. "Slughorn could've handed me that book, but no, I get the one no one's ever written on. Puked on, by the look of page fifty-two, but-"
"Hang on," said a voice close by Harry's left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn's dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them. "Did I hear right? You've been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?"
She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her mind at once.
"It's nothing," he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. "It's not like, you know, Riddle's diary. It's just an old textbook someone's scribbled on." 
"But you're doing what it says?"
"I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there's nothing funny -"
"Ginny's got a point," said Hermione, perking up at once. "We ought to check that there's nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?"
"Hey!" said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised her wand. "Specialis Revelio!" she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover. Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared.
"Finished?" said Harry irritably. "Or d'you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips?"
"It seems all right," said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously. "I mean, it really does seem to be ... just a textbook."
"Good. Then I'll have it back," said Harry, snatching it off the table, but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor. Nobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.
This book is the property of the Half Blood Prince.

Chapter 10: The house of count


For or the rest of the week's Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince's instructions wherever they de-viated from Libatius Borage's, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about Harrys abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the "official" instruc-tions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince's. 
Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were direc-tions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself. 
"Or herself," said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry point-ing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. "It might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl's than a boy's." 
"The Half-Blood Prince, he was called," Harry said. "How many girls have been Princes?" 
Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and twitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away from Ron, who was trying to read it upside down. 
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag. 
"It's five to eight, I'd better go, I'll be late for Dumbledore." 
"Ooooh!" gasped Hermione, looking up at once. "Good luck! We'll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!" 
"Hope it goes okay," said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave through the portrait hole. 
Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as she walked. 
"Two of spades: conflict," she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. "Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner " 
She stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry's statue. 
"Well, that can't be right," she said, annoyed, and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall. 
"Acid Pops," said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was re-vealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledore's Office. 
Harry knocked. 
"Come in," said Dumbledore s voice. 
"Good evening, sir," said Harry, walking into the headmaster's office. 
"Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down," said Dumbledore, smil-ing. "I hope you've had an enjoyable first week back at school?" "Yes, thanks, sir," said Harry. 
"You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!" "Er," began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did not look too stern. 
"I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your de-tention next Saturday instead." 
"Right," said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snapes detention, and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puff-ing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore's magnifi-cent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watch-ing Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice. 
"So, Harry," said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. "You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you dur-ing these  for want of a better word  lessons?" 
"Yes, sir." 
"Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information." There was a pause. 
"You said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything," said Harry. It was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice. "Sir," he added. 
"And so I did," said Dumbledore placidly. "I told you everything I know. From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm founda-tion of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who be-lieved the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron." 
"But you think you're right?" said Harry. 
"Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mis-takes like the next man. In fact, being  forgive me  rather clev-erer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger." 
"Sir," said Harry tentatively, "does what you're going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me . . . survive?" 
"It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy," said Dumble-dore, as casually as if Harry had asked him about the next days weather, "and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive,." 
Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bend-ing over the cabinet beside the door. When Dumbledore straight-ened up, he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry. 
"You look worried." 
Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some appre-hension. His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive, had also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its contents, he had seen much more than he would have wished. But Dumbledore was smiling. 
"This time, you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and, even more unusually, with permission." 
"Where are we going, sir?" 
"For a trip down Bob Ogden's memory lane," said Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery-white substance. 
"Who was Bob Ogden?" 
"He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforce-ment," said Dumbledore. "He died some time ago, but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recol-lections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry ..." 
But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed stiff and painful. 
"Shall shall I, sir?" 
"No matter, Harry " 
Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out. 
"Sir  how did you injure your hand?" Harry asked again, look-ing at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity. 
"Now is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. We have an appointment with Bob Ogden." 
  
Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, neither liquid nor gas. "After you," said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the bowl. Harry bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged his face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite sud-denly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him. 
They were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inex-perienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane. 
Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read: Great Hangleton, 5 miles. The arm pointing after Ogden said Little Hangleton, 1 mile. 
They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frock-coated figure ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could see a vil-lage, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn. 
Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep down-ward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final desti-nation and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden's frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge. 
Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping down-hill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up 
at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand. 
Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry's eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking. 
Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. 
Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled. 
"You're not welcome." 
The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frighten-ing, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke. 
"Er  good morning. I'm from the Ministry of Magic " "You're not welcome." 
"Er  I'm sorry  I don't understand you," said Ogden nervously. 
Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harry's opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other. 
"You understand him, I'm sure, Harry?" said Dumbledore quietly. "Yes, of course," said Harry, slightly nonplussed. "Why can't Ogden  ?" 
But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he sud-denly understood. 
"He's speaking Parseltongue?" 
"Very good," said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling. 
The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other. 
"Now, look " Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers. 
"Morfin!" said a loud voice. 
An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground. 
"Ministry, is it?" said the older man, looking down at Ogden. "Correct!" said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. "And you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?" 
"S'right," said Gaunt. "Got you in the face, did he?" "Yes, he did!" snapped Ogden. 
"Should've made your presence known, shouldn't you?" said Gaunt aggressively. "This is private property. Can't just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself." 
"Defend himself against what, man?" said Ogden, clambering back to his feet. 
"Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth." Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin. "Get in the house. Don't argue." 
This time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was being said, he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again. 
"It's your son I'm here to see, Mr. Gaunt," said Ogden, as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. "That was Morfin, wasn't it?" 
"At, that was Morfin," said the old man indifferently. "Are you pure-blood?" he asked, suddenly aggressive. 
"That's neither here nor there," said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently. 
He squinted into Ogdens lace and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, "Now I come to think about it, I've seen noses like yours down in the village." 
"I don't doubt it, if your sons been let loose on them," said Og-den. "Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?" 
"Inside?" 
"Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I've already told you. I'm here about Morfin. We sent an owl " 
"I've no use for owls," said Gaunt. "I don't open letters." 
"Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of vis-itors," said Ogden tartly. "I am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this morning " 
"All right, all right, all right!" bellowed Gaunt. "Come in the bleeding house, then, and much good it'll do you!" 
The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room com-bined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue: 
Hissy, hissy, little snakey, 
Slither on the floor 
You be good to Morfin 
Or he'll nail you to the door. 
There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open win-dow, and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone 
wall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother's, stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-looking person. 
"M'daughter, Merope," said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked 
inquiringly toward her. 
"Good morning," said Ogden. 
She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her. 
"Well, Mr. Gaunt," said Ogden, "to get straight to the point, we have reason to believe that your son, Morfin, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night." 
There was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped one of the pots. 
"Pick it up!" Gaunt bellowed at her. "That's it, grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle, what's your wand for, you useless sack of muck?" 
"Mr. Gaunt, please!" said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again1 drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the op-posite wall, and crack in two. 
Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed, "Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!" 
Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, "Reparo. " The pot mended itself instantly. 
Gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at Ogden, but seemed to think better of it: Instead, he jeered at his daughter, "Lucky the nice man from the Ministry's here, isn't it? Perhaps he'll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn't mind dirty Squibs. . . ." 
Without looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish. 
"Mr. Gaunt," Ogden began again, "as I've said: the reason for my visit " 
"I heard you the first time!" snapped Gaunt. "And so what? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him  what about it, then?" 
"Morfin has broken Wizarding law," said Ogden sternly. 
"'Morfin has broken Wizarding law.'" Gaunt imitated Ogdens voice, making it pompous and singsong. Morfin cackled again. "He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, that's illegal now, is it?" 
"Yes," said Ogden. "I'm afraid it is." 
He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it. 
"What's that, then, his sentence?" said Gaunt, his voice rising angrily. 
"It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing " 
"Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning my son anywhere?" 
"I'm Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad," said Ogden. 
"And you think we're scum, do you?" screamed Gaunt, advanc-ing on Ogden now, with a dirty yellow-nailed finger pointing at his chest. "Scum who'll come running when the Ministry tells 'em to? Do you know who you're talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do you?" 
"I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt," said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his ground. 
"That's right!" roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger, waving it before Ogden's eyes. "See this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries it's been in our family, that's how far back we go, and pure-blood all the way! Know how much I've been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?" 
"I've really no idea," said Ogden, blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose, "and it's quite beside the point, Mr. Gaunt. Your son has committed " 
With a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. For a split second, Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold chain around her neck. 
"See this?" he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and gasped for breath. 
"I see it, I see it!" said Ogden hastily. 
"Slytherins!" yelled Gaunt. "Salazar Slytherin's! We're his last liv-ing descendants, what do you say to that, eh?" 
"Mr. Gaunt, your daughter!" said Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered away from him, back to her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air. 
"So!" said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute. "Don't you go talk-ing to us as if we're dirt on your shoes! Generations of purebloods, wizards all  more than you can say, I don't doubt!" 
And he spat on the floor at Ogdens feet. Morfin cackled again. Merope, huddled beside the window, her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, said nothing. 
"Mr. Gaunt," said Ogden doggedly, "I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he ac-costed late last night. Our information"  he glanced down at his scroll of parchment  "is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives." 
Morfin giggled. 
"Be quiet, boy," snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell silent again. 
"And so what if he did, then?" Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden, "I expect you've wiped the Muggle's filthy face clean for him, and his memory to boot " 
"That's hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?" said Ogden. "This was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless " 
"Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw you," sneered Gaunt, and he spat on the floor again. 
"This discussion is getting us nowhere," said Ogden firmly. "It is clear from your son's attitude that he feels no remorse for his ac-tions." He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. "Morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg " 
Ogden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and loud, laughing voices were drifting in through the open window. Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide. Morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her head. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly white. 
"My God, what an eyesore!" rang out a girl's voice, as clearly au-dible through the open window as if she had stood in the room be-side them. "Couldn't your father have that hovel cleared away, Tom?" 
"It's not ours," said a young man's voice. "Everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us, but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt, and his children. The son's quite mad, you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village " 
The girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were growing louder and louder. Morfin made to get out of his armchair. , "Keep your seat," said his father warningly, in Parseltongue. 
"Tom," said the girl's voice again, now so close they were clearly right beside the house, "I might be wrong  but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?" 
"Good lord, you're right!" said the man's voice. "That'll be the son, I told you he's not right in the head. Don't look at it, Cecilia, darling. 
The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing faint again. 
"'Darling,'" whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, looking at his sister. "'Darling, he called her. So he wouldn't have you anyway." 
Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint. 
"What's that?" said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter. "What did you say, Morfin?" 
"She likes looking at that Muggle, "said Morfin, a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister, who now looked terrified. "Always in the garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at him, isn't she? And last night  " 
Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on ruthlessly, "Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home, wasn't she?" 
"Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?" said Gaunt quietly. 
All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden, who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping. 
"Is it true?" said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl. "My daughterpure-blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin  hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle?" 
Merope shook her head frantically, pressing herself into the wall, apparently unable to speak. 
"But I got him, Father!" cackled Morfin. "I got him as he went by and he didn't look so pretty with hives all over him, did he, Merope?" 
"You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!" roared Gaunt, losing control, and his hands closed around his daughter's throat. 
Both Harry and Ogden yelled "No!" at the same time; Ogden raised his wand and cried, "Relaskio!" 
Gaunt was thrown backward, away from his daughter; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand. 
Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope's screams echoing in his ears. 
Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man. Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horse's flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell up the lane. 
"I think that will do, Harry," said Dumbledore. He took Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, back in Dumbledore's now twilit office. 
"What happened to the girl in the cottage?" said Harry at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand. "Merope, or whatever her name was?" 
"Oh, she survived," said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too. "Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subse-quently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees addition to Ogden, received six months." 
"Marvolo?" Harry repeated wonderingly. 
"That's right," said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. "I am glad to see you're keeping up." 
"That old man was  ?" 
"Voldemort's grandfather, yes," said Dumbledore. "Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of insta-bility and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter." 
"So Merope," said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and star-ing at Dumbledore, "so Merope was . . . Sir, does that mean she was . . . Voldemort's mother?" 
"It does," said Dumbledore. "And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort's father. I wonder whether you noticed?" 
"The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?" 
"Very good indeed," said Dumbledore, beaming. "Yes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion." 
"And they ended up married?" Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love. 
  
"I think you are forgetting," said Dumbledore, "that Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years." 
"Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?" 
"The Imperius Curse?" Harry suggested. "Or a love potion?" 
"Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her, and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot day, when Riddle was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of water. In any case, within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire's son ran off with the tramp's daughter, Merope." 
"But the villagers' shock was nothing to Marvolo's. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done." 
"From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her de-sertion may have contributed to his early death  or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage." 
"And Merope? She . .. she died, didn't she? Wasn't Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?" 
"Yes, indeed," said Dumbledore. "We must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighbor-hood that he was talking of being 'hoodwinked' and 'taken in.' What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchant-ment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason." 
"But she did have his baby." 
"But not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant." 
"What went wrong?" asked Harry. "Why did the love potion stop working?" 
"Again, this is guesswork," said Dumbledore, "but I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby's sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son." 
The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore's office seemed to glow more brightly than before. 
"I think that will do for tonight, Harry," said Dumbledore after a moment or two. 
"Yes, sir," said Harry. 
He got to his feet, but did not leave. 
"Sir ... is it important to know all this about Voldemort's past?" 
"Very important, I think," said Dumbledore. 
"And it... it's got something to do with the prophecy?" 
"It has everything to do with the prophecy." 
"Right," said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same. 
He turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he turned back again. "Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you've told me?" 
Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, "Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trust-worthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort's secrets." 
"No, sir, I'll make sure it's just Ron and Hermione. Good night." 
He turned away again, and was almost at the door when he saw it. Sitting on one of the little spindle-legged tables that supported so many frail-looking silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set with a large, cracked, black stone. 
"Sir," said Harry, staring at it. "That ring" 
"Yes?" said Dumbledore. 
"You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night." 
"So I was," Dumbledore agreed. 
"But isn't it... sir, isn't it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden?" 
Dumbledore bowed his head. "The very same." 
"But how come  ? Have you always had it?" 
"No, I acquired it very recently," said Dumbledore. "A few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle's, in fact." 
"That would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?" 
"Around that time, yes, Harry." 
Harry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling. 
"Sir, how exactly  ?" 
"Too late, Harry! You shall hear the story another time. Good night." 
"Good night, sir." 

Chapter 11: Hermione's helping hand


As Hermione had predicted, the sixth years' free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had antici-pated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set. Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons them-selves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. Incredibly, and to Hermione's increasing resentment, Harry's best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince. 
Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incanta-tions aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind. 
One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid. He had stopped coming to meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings. 
"We've got to go and explain," said Hermione, looking up at Hagrid's huge empty chair at the staff table the following Saturday at breakfast. 
"We've got Quidditch tryouts this morning!" said Ron. "And we're supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject?" 
"We didn't hate it!" said Hermione. 
"Speak for yourself, I haven't forgotten the skrewts," said Ron darkly. "And I'm telling you now, we've had a narrow escape. You didn't hear him going on about his gormless brother  we'd have been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we'd stayed." 
"I hate not talking to Hagrid," said Hermione, looking upset. 
"We'll go down after Quidditch," Harry assured her. He too was missing Hagrid, although like Ron he thought that they were bet-ter off without Grawp in their lives. "But trials might take all morning, the number of people who have applied." He felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his Captaincy. "I dunno why the team's this popular all of a sudden." 
"Oh, come on, Harry," said Hermione, suddenly impatient. "It's not Quidditch that's popular, it's you! You've never been more in-teresting, and frankly, you've never been more fanciable." 
Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper. Hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning back to Harry. 
"Everyone knows you've been telling the truth now, don't they? The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now they're calling you 'the Chosen One'  well, come on, can't you see why people are fascinated by you?" 
Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy. 
"And you've been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to your story anyway. ..." 
"You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Min-istry, look," said Ron, shaking back his sleeves. 
"And it doesn't hurt that you've grown about a foot over the summer either," Hermione finished, ignoring Ron. 
"I'm tall," said Ron inconsequentially. 
The post owls arrived, swooping down through rain-flecked windows, scattering everyone with droplets of water. Most people were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home. Harry had received no mail since the start of term; his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later, an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon. 
"Ha!" said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from Flourish and Blotts. 
"Oh good," said Hermione, delighted. "Now you can give that graffitied copy back." 
"Are you mad?" said Harry. "I'm keeping it! Look, I've thought it out " 
He pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand, muttering, "Dijjindo!" The cover fell off. He did the same thing with the brand-new book (Hermione looked scandalized). He then swapped the covers, tapped each, and said, "Reparo!" 
There sat the Prince's copy, disguised as a new book, and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, looking thoroughly secondhand. 
"I'll give Slughorn back the new one, he can't complain, it cost nine Galleons." 
Hermione pressed her lips together, looking angry and disap-proving, but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that day's copy of the Daily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page. 
"Anyone we know dead?" asked Ron in a determinedly casual voice; he posed the same question every time Hermione opened her paper. 
"No, but there have been more dementor attacks," said Hermi-one. "And an arrest." 
"Excellent, who?" said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange. "Stan Shunpike," said Hermione. 
"What?" said Harry, startled. 
"'Stanley Shunpike, conductor on the popular Wizarding con-veyance the Knight Bus, has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Mr. Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his Clapham home. . .'" 
"Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?" said Harry, remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years before. "No way!" 
"He might have been put under the Imperius Curse," said Ron reasonably. "You never can tell." 
"It doesn't look like it," said Hermione, who was still reading. "It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters' secret plans in a pub." She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. "If he was under the Imperius Curse, he'd hardly stand around gossiping about their plans, would he?" 
"It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did," said Ron. "Isn't he the one who claimed he was going to be-come Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?" 
"Yeah, that's him," said Harry. "I dunno what they're playing at, taking Stan seriously." 
"They probably want to look as though they're doing some-thing," said Hermione, frowning. "People are terrified  you know the Patil twins' parents want them to go home? And Eloise Midgen has already been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night." 
"What!" said Ron, goggling at Hermione. "But Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be! We've got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells, and we've got Dumbledore!" 
"I don't think we've got him all the time," said Hermione very quietly, glancing toward the staff table over the top of the Prophet. "Haven't you noticed? His seat's been empty as often as Hagrid's this past week." 
Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmaster's chair was indeed empty. Now Harry came to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago. 
"I think he's left the school to do something with the Order," said Hermione in a low voice. "I mean . . . it's all looking serious, isn't it?" 
Harry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. There had been a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since. 
When they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil twins' parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering to-gether, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became something more like a strut. Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, re-membering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harry's nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck. 
As Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning. Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up, from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating. The latter included a large, wiry-haired boy Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express. 
"We met on the train, in old Sluggy's compartment," he said confidently, stepping out of the crowd to shake Harry's hand. "Cormac McLaggen, Keeper." 
"You didn't try out last year, did you?" asked Harry, taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving. 
"I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials," said McLaggen, with something of a swagger. "Ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet." 
"Right," said Harry. "Well. . . if you wait over there ..." He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermi-one was sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggen's face and wondered whether McLaggen expected pref-erential treatment because they were both "old Sluggy's" favorites. Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch. This was a good decision: the first ten was made up of first years, and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts. 
The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When he told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else. 
The third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs. 
"If there's anyone else here who's not from Gryffindor," roared Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, "leave now, please! 
There was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter. 
After two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one in-volving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, Harry had found himself three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and Ginny Weasley, who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters. 
"That's my final decision and if you don't get out of the way of the Keepers I'll hex you," he bellowed. 
Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry's head with a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well. They now joined Katie, Demelza, and Ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member. 
Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever. As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green. 
None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece. To Harry's great disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five. On the last one, however, he shot off in completely the wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth. 
Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven. "Good luck!" cried a voice from the stands. Harry looked around, expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial. 
Yet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted, and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that, most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find McLaggen's red face inches from his own. He stepped back hastily. 
"His sister didn't really try," said McLaggen menacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often ad-mired in Uncle Vernon's. "She gave him an easy save." 
"Rubbish," said Harry coldly. "That was the one he nearly missed." 
McLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this time. 
"Give me another go." 
"No," said Harry. "You've had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ron's Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my way." 
He thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him, but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away, growling what sounded like threats to thin air. 
Harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him. 
"Well done," he croaked. "You flew really well " 
"You did brilliantly, Ron!" 
This time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Hermione. 
After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade good-bye to the rest of the team and headed off toward Hagrid's. A watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there would be some-thing to eat at Hagrid's. 
"I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty," Ron was say-ing happily. "Tricky shot from Demelza, did you see, had a bit of spin on it " 
"Yes, yes, you were magnificent," said Hermione, looking amused. 
"I was better than that McLaggen anyway," said Ron in a highly satisfied voice. "Did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direc-tion on his fifth? Looked like he'd been Confunded. ..." 
To Harry's surprise, Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words. Ron noticed nothing; he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail. 
The great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of Hagrid's cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them. 
"Oh dear," said Hermione nervously. "He's still a bit scary, isn't he?" 
"Come off it, you've ridden him, haven't you?" said Ron. Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too. 
"How are you?" Harry asked him in a low voice, moving for-ward to stroke the feathery head. "Missing him? But you're okay here with Hagrid, aren't you?" 
"Oi!" said a loud voice. 
Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes. His enormous boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward. 
"Git away from him! He'll have yer fingers  oh. It's yeh lot." 
Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, attempting to lick their ears. Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second, then turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door behind him. 
"Oh dear!" said Hermione, looking stricken. 
"Don't worry about it," said Harry grimly. He walked over to the door and knocked loudly. "Hagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!" 
There was no sound from within. 
"If you don't open the door, we'll blast it open!" Harry said, pulling out his wand. 
"Harry!" said Hermione, sounding shocked. "You can't pos-sibly " 
"Yeah, I can!" said Harry. "Stand back " 
But before he could say anything else, the door flew open again as Harry had known it would, and there stood Hagrid, glowering down at him and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming. 
"I'm a teacher!" he roared at Harry. "A teacher, Potter! How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!" 
"I'm sorry, sir" said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes. 
Hagrid looked stunned. "Since when have yeh called me 'sir'?" 
"Since when have you called me 'Potter'?" 
"Oh, very clever," growled Hagrid. "Very amusin'. That's me outsmarted, innit? All righ', come in then, yeh ungrateful little . . ." 
Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Hermione scurried in after Harry, looking rather frightened.
"Well?" said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table, Fang laying his head im-mediately upon Harry's knee and drooling all over his robes. "What's this? Feelin' sorry for me? Reckon I'm lonely or summat?" 
"No," said Harry at once. "We wanted to see you." 
"We've missed you!" said Hermione tremulously. 
"Missed me, have yeh?" snorted Hagrid. "Yeah. Righ'." 
He stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrid's cooking, and took one at once. 
"Hagrid," said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that sug-gested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong, "we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know." Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought some bo-geys landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner. 
"We did!" said Hermione. "But none of us could fit it into our schedules!" 
"Yeah. Righ'," said Hagrid again. 
There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked like foot-long maggots, slimy, white, and writhing. 
"What are they, Hagrid?" asked Harry, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same. 
"Jus' giant grubs," said Hagrid. 
"And they grow into ... ?" said Ron, looking apprehensive. 
"They won' grow inter nuthin'," said Hagrid. "I got 'em ter feed ter Aragog." 
And without warning, he burst into tears. 
"Hagrid!" cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders. "What is it?" 
"It's. . . him . .." gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes stream-ing as he mopped his face with his apron. "It's . . . Aragog. ... I think he's dyin'. . , . He got ill over the summer an' he's not gettin' better.... I don' know what I'll do if he ... if he ... We've bin tergether so long. ..." 
Hermione patted Hagrid's shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Ha-grid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously. 
"Is there  is there anything we can do?" Hermione asked, ig-noring Ron's frantic grimaces and head-shakings. 
"I don' think there is, Hermione," choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the flood of his tears. "See, the rest o' the tribe ... Aragog's family . . . they're gettin' a bit funny now he's ill... bit restive ..." 
"Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them," said Ron in an undertone. 
"... I don' reckon it'd be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo'," Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up. "But thanks fer offerin', Hermione. ... It means a lot. . .." 
After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and be-came his usual self once more. 
"Ar, I always knew yeh'd find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables," he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. "Even if yeh applied fer Time-Turners " 
"We couldn't have done," said Hermione. "We smashed the en-tire stock of Ministry Time-Turners when we were there last sum-mer. It was in the Daily Prophet." 
"Ar, well then," said Hagrid. "There's no way yeh could've done it. ... I'm sorry I've bin  yeh know  I've jus' bin worried about Aragog ... an I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin teachin' yeh " 
At which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had substituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite cheerful. 
  
"I'm starving," said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous crack-ing noise from one of his back teeth. "And I've got that detention with Snape tonight, I haven't got much time for dinner. ..." 
As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen en-tering the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught Hermione's arm and held her back. 
"What?" said Hermione defensively. 
"If you ask me," said Harry quietly, "McLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning. And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting." 
Hermione blushed. 
"Oh, all right then, I did it," she whispered. "But you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Any-way, he's got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didn't get in  you wouldn't have wanted someone like that on the team." 
"No," said Harry. "No, I suppose that's true. But wasn't that dis-honest, Hermione? I mean, you're a prefect, aren't you?" 
"Oh, be quiet," she snapped, as he smirked. 
"What are you two doing?" demanded Ron, reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious. 
"Nothing," said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried after Ron. The smell of roast beef made Harry's stomach ache with hunger, but they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, blocking their path. 
"Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!" he boomed ge-nially, twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly, "I was hoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We're having a little party, just a few rising stars, I've got McLaggen com-ing and Zabini, the charming Melinda Bobbin  I don't know whether you know her? Her family owns a large chain of apothe-caries  and, of course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too." 
Slughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking. It was as though Ron was not present; Slughorn did not so much as look at him. 
"I can't come, Professor," said Harry at once. "I've got a deten-tion with Professor Snape." 
"Oh dear!" said Slughorn, his face falling comically. "Dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, I'll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation. I'm sure I'll be able to per-suade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I'll see you both later!" He bustled away out of the Hall. 
"He's got no chance of persuading Snape," said Harry, the mo-ment Slughorn was out of earshot. "This detentions already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won't do it for anyone else." 
"Oh, I wish you could come, I don't want to go on my own!" said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen. 
"I doubt you'll be alone, Ginny'll probably be invited," snapped Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn. 
After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a chair. 
"Anything new?" said Harry. 
"Not really. . ." Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages. "Oh, look, your dad's in here, Ron  he's all right!" she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. "It just says he's been to visit the Malfoys' house. 'This sec-ond search of the Death Eaters residence does not seem to have yielded any results. Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confis-cation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tip-off.'" 
"Yeah, mine!" said Harry. "I told him at Kings Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if it's not at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him " 
"But how can he have done, Harry?" said Hermione, putting down the newspaper with a surprised look. "We were all searched when we arrived, weren't we?" 
"Were you?" said Harry, taken aback. "I wasn't!" 
"Oh no, of course you weren't, I forgot you were late. . .. Well, Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the entrance hall. Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy can't have brought in anything dangerous!" 
Momentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection. 
"Someone's sent it to him by owl, then," he said. "His mother or someone." 
"All the owls are being checked too," said Hermione. "Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach." 
Really stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say. There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the school. He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown. 
"Can you think of any way Malfoy  ?" 
"Oh, drop it, Harry," said Ron. 
"Listen, it's not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know!" said Harry, firing up. 
"Well, as I'm not invited to any parties," said Ron, getting to his feet again, "I think I'll go to bed." 
He stomped off toward the door to the boys' dormitories, leav-ing Harry and Hermione staring after him. 
"Harry?" said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, appearing suddenly at his shoulder. "I've got a message for you." 
"From Professor Slughorn?" asked Harry, sitting up hopefully. 
"No .. . from Professor Snape," said Demelza. Harry's heart sank. "He says you're to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention  er  no matter how many party invita-tions you've received. And he wanted you to know you'll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions and  and he says there's no need to bring protective gloves." 
"Right," said Harry grimly. "Thanks a lot, Demelza." 
  

Chapter 12: Silver and opals


Where was Dumbledore, and what was he doing? 
Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next lew weeks. He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned. 
Halfway through October came their first trip of the term to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours. 
Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed 
reading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the Half-Blood Princes copy of Advanced Potion-Making hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored over the book, the more he realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that was earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself. 
Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince's self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class with out being overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity. 
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble: 
  
Levicorpus (nvbl) 
While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. Nvbl . . that had to mean "nonverbal." Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far. 
Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head. "Aaaaaaaargh!" 
There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle. 
"Sorry!" yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and Neville picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of Bed. "Hang on  I'll let you down " 
He groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic, trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered 
the cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the counter-jinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus! with all his might. There was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a heap onto his mattress. 
"Sorry," repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter. 
"Tomorrow," said Ron in a muffled voice, "I'd rather you set the alarm clock." 
By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Mrs. Weasleys hand-knitted sweaters and carrying, cloaks, scarves, and gloves, Ron's shock had subsided and he had decided that Harry's new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast. 
"... and then there was another flash, of light and I landed on the bed again!" Ron grinned, helping himself to sausages. 
Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry. 
"Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours?" she asked. 
Harry frowned at her. 
"Always jump to the worst conclusion, don't you?" 
"Was it?" 
"Well. . . yeah, it was, but so what?" 
"So you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten in-cantation and see what would happen?" 
"Why does it matter if it's handwritten?" said Harry, preferring not to answer the rest of the question. 
"Because its probably not Ministry of Magic approved," said Hermione. "And also," she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, "because I'm starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy." 
Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once. 
"It was a laugh!" said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages. "Just a laugh, Hermione, that's all!" 
"Dangling people upside down by the ankle?" said Hermi-one. "Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that?" 
"Fred and George," said Ron, shrugging, "it's their kind of thing. And, er" 
"My dad," said Harry. He had only just remembered. 
"What?" said Ron and Hermione together. 
"My dad used this spell," said Harry. "I  Lupin told me." 
'This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a won-derful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be  ? 
"Maybe your dad did use it, Harry," said Hermione, "but he's not the only one. We've seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case you've forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them float along, asleep, helpless." 
Harry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too remembered the behavior of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup. Ron came to his aid. 
"That was different," he said robustly. "They were abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a laugh. You don't like the Prince, Hermione," he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, "because he's better than you at Potions " 
"It's got nothing to do with that!" said Hermione, her cheeks reddening. "I just think it's very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don't even know what they're for, and stop talking about 'the Prince' as if it's his title, I bet it's just a stupid nickname, and it doesn't seem as though he was a very nice person to me!" 
"I don't see where you get that from," said Harry heatedly. "If he'd been a budding Death Eater he wouldn't have been boasting about being 'half-blood,' would he?" 
Even as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would worry about that later. . . . 
"The Death Eaters can't all be pure-blood, there aren't enough pure-blood wizards left," said Hermione stubbornly. "I expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It's only Muggle-borns they hate, they'd be quite happy to let you and Ron join up." 
"There is no way they'd let me be a Death Eater!" said Ron in-dignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandish-ing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head. "My whole family are blood traitors! That's as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters!" 
"And they'd love to have me," said Harry sarcastically. "We'd be best pals if they didn't keep trying to do me in." 
This made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny. 
"Hey, Harry, I'm supposed to give you this." 
It was a scroll of parchment with Harry's name written upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing. 
"Thanks, Ginny. . . It's Dumbledore's next lesson!" Harry told Ron and Hermione, pulling open the parchment and quickly read-ing its contents. "Monday evening!" He felt suddenly light and happy. "Want to join us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?" he asked. 
"I'm going with Dean  might see you there," she replied, wav-ing at them as she left. 
  
Filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade. The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triple-checking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor. 
"What does it matter if we're smuggling Dark stuff OUT?" de-manded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehen-sion. "Surely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN?" 
His cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet. 
The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb. The road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind. More than once Harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko's Joke Shop had been boarded up, Harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun. Ron pointed, with a thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was mercifully open, and Harry and Hermione staggered in his wake into the crowded shop. 
"Thank God," shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm, toffee-scented air. "Let's stay here all afternoon." 
"Harry, m'boy!" said a booming voice from behind them. 
"Oh no," muttered Harry. The three of them turned to see Pro-fessor Slughorn, who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple, and occupying at least a quarter of the shop. 
"Harry, that's three of my little suppers you've missed now!" said Slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. "It won't do, m'boy, I'm determined to have you! Miss Granger loves them, don't you?" 
"Yes," said Hermione helplessly, "they're really " 
"So why don't you come along, Harry?" demanded Slughorn. 
"Well, I've had Quidditch practice, Professor," said Harry, who had indeed been scheduling practices every time Slughorn had sent him a little, violet ribbon-adorned invitation. This strategy meant that Ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with Ginny, imagining Hermione shut up with McLaggen and Zabini. 
"Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all the, hard work!" said Slughorn. "But a little recreation never hurt any body. Now, how about Monday night, you can't possibly want to practice in this weather...." 
"I can't, Professor, I've got  er  an appointment with Profes-sor Dumbledore that evening." 
"Unlucky again!" cried Slughorn dramatically. "Ah, well . . . you can't evade me forever, Harry!" 
And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as lit-tle notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach Clusters. 
"I can't believe you've wriggled out of another one," said Hermione, shaking her head. "They're not that bad, you know. . . They're even quite fun sometimes. . . ." But then she caught sight of Ron's expression. "Oh, look  they've got deluxe sugar quills  those would last hours!" 
Glad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry showed much more interest in the new extra-large sugar quills than he would normally have done, but Ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when Hermione asked him where he wanted to go next. 
"Let's go to the Three Broomsticks," said Harry. "It'll be warm." 
They bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop. The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; no- 
body was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog's Head. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was. 
"Mundungus!" 
The squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releas-ing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window. 
"Oh, 'ello, 'Arry," said Mundungus Fletcher, with a most un-convincing stab at airiness. "Well, don't let me keep ya." 
And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone. 
"Are you selling this stuff?" asked Harry, watching Mundungus grab an assortment of grubby-looking objects from the ground. 
"Oh, well, gotta scrape a living," said Mundungus. "Gimme that!" 
Ron had stooped down and picked up something silver. 
"Hang on," Ron said slowly. "This looks familiar " 
"Thank you!" said Mundungus, snatching the goblet out of Ron's hand and stuffing it back into the case. "Well, I'll see you all _ OUCH!" 
Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his wand. 
"Harry!" squealed Hermione. 
"You rook that from Sinus's house," said Harry, who was almost nose to nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits. "That had the Black family crest on it." 
"I  no  what  ?" spluttered Mundungus, who was slowly turning purple. 
"What did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?" snarled Harry. 
"I  no  " 
"Give it to me!" 
"Harry, you mustn't!" shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus started to turn blue. 
There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus's throat. Gasping and spluttering, Mundungus seized his fallen case, then  CRACK he Disapparated. 
Harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see where Mundungus had gone. 
"COME BACK, YOU THIEVING  !" 
"There's no point, Harry." Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with sleet. 
"Mundungus will probably be in London by now. There's no point yelling." 
"He's nicked Sirius's stuff! Nicked it!" 
"Yes, but still," said Tonks, who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information. "You should get out of the cold." 
She watched them go through the door of the Three Broom-sticks. The moment he was inside, Harry burst out, "He was nicking Sirius's stuff!" 
"I know, Harry, but please don't shout, people are staring," whis-pered Hermione. "Go and sit down, I'll get you a drink." 
Harry was still fuming when Hermione returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer. 
"Can't the Order control Mundungus?" Harry demanded of the other two in a furious whisper. "Can't they at least stop him steal-ing everything that's not fixed down when he's at headquarters?" 
"Shh!" said Hermione desperately, looking around to make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry with great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away. "Harry, I'd be annoyed too, I know it's your things he's stealing " 
Harry gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place. 
"Yeah, it's my stuff!" he said. "No wonder he wasn't pleased to see me! Well, I'm going to tell Dumbledore what's going on, he's the only one who scares Mundungus." 
"Good idea," whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that Harry was calming down. "Ron, what are you staring at?" 
"Nothing," said Ron, hastily looking away from the bar, but Harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive bar-maid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot. 
"I expect 'nothing's' in the back getting more firewhisky," said Hermione waspishly. 
Ron ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence. Harry was thinking about Sirius, and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway. Hermione drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron and the bar. The moment Harry drained the last drops in his bot-tle she said, "Shall we call it a day and go back to school, then?" 
The other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. Once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them, rearranged their scarves, pulled on their gloves, then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the High Street. Harry's thoughts strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush. They had not met up with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry, because she and Dean were cozily closeted in Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop, that haunt of happy couples. Scowling, he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on. 
It was a little while before Harry became aware that the voices of Katie Bell and her friend, which were being carried back to him on the wind, had become shriller and louder. Harry squinted at their indistinct figures. The two girls were having an argument about something Katie was holding in her hand. "It's nothing to do with you, Leanne!" Harry heard Katie say. 
They rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick and fast, blurring Harry's glasses. Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them, Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie was holding; Katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground. 
At once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, suspended comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her arms outstretched, as though she was about to fly. Yet there was something wrong, some-thing eerie. . . . Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of 
expression. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching. 
Then, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a terrible scream. Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly causing her terrible anguish. She screamed and screamed; Leanne started to scream too and seized Katie's ankles, trying to tug her back to the ground. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rushed forward to help, but even as they grabbed Katie's legs, she fell on top of them; Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. Instead they low-ered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed, appar-ently unable to recognize any of them. 
Harry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted. 
"Stay there!" he shouted at the others over the howling wind. "I'm going for help!" 
He began to sprint toward the school; he had never seen anyone behave as Katie had just behaved and could not think what had caused it; he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs. 
"Hagrid!" he panted, disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen. 
"Harry!" said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great, shaggy beaverskin coat. "Jus' bin visitin' Grawp, he's comin' on so well yeh wouldn' " 
"Hagrid, someone's hurt back there, or cursed, or something " 
"Wha ?" said Hagrid, bending lower to hear what Harry was say-ing over the raging wind. 
"Someone's been cursed!" bellowed Harry. :, .' 
"Cursed? Who's bin cursed  not Ron? Hermione?" : 
"No, it's not them, it's Katie Bell  this way . . ." 
Together they ran back along the lane. It took them no time to find the little group of people around Katie, who was still writhing and screaming on the ground; Ron, Hermione, and Leanne were all trying to quiet her. 
"Get back!" shouted Hagrid. "Lemme see her!" 
"Something's happened to her!" sobbed Leanne. "I don't know what " 
Hagrid stared at Katie for a second, then without a word, bent down, scooped her into his arms, and ran off toward the castle with her. Within seconds, Katie's piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind. 
Hermione hurried over to Katie's wailing friend and put an arm around her. 
"It's Leanne, isn't it?" 
The girl nodded. 
"Did it just happen all of a sudden, or  ?" 
"It was when that package tore," sobbed Leanne, pointing at the now sodden brown-paper package on the ground, which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter. Ron bent down, his hand out-stretched, but Harry seized his arm and pulled him back. 
"Don't touch it!" 
He crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was visible, poking out of the paper. 
"I've seen that before," said Harry, staring at the thing. "It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago. The label said it was cursed. Katie must have touched it." He looked up at Leanne, who had started to shake uncontrollably. "How did Katie get hold of this?" 
"Well, that's why we were arguing. She came back from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it, said it was a sur-prise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it. She looked all funny when she said it. ... Oh no, oh no, I bet she'd been Imperiused and I didn't realize!" 
Leanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione patted her shoulder gently. 
"She didn't say who'd given it to her, Leanne?" 
"No . . . she wouldn't tell me . . . and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school, but she just wouldn't listen and . . . and then I tried to grab it from her . . . and  and " 
Leanne let out a wail of despair. 
"We'd better get up to school," said Hermione, her arm still around Leanne. "We'll be able to find out how she is. Come on. . . ." 
Harry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around his face and, ignoring Ron's gasp, carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up. 
"We'll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey," he said. 
As they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, Harry was thinking furiously. They had just entered the grounds when he spoke, unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer. 
"Malfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad. This is what he was buying that day when we followed him! He remembered it and he went back for it!" , 
"I  I dunno, Harry," said Ron hesitantly. "Loads of people go 
to Borgin and Burkes . . . and didn't that girl say Katie got it in the girls' bathroom?" 
"She said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didn't necessarily get it in the bathroom itself" 
"McGonagall!" said Ron warningly. 
Harry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall was hur-rying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them. 
"Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell  upstairs to my office at once, please! What's that you're holding, Potter?" 
"It's the thing she touched," said Harry. 
"Good lord," said Professor McGonagall, looking alarmed as she took the necklace from Harry. "No, no, Filch, they're with me!" she added hastily, as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. "Take this necklace to Profes-sor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!" 
Harry and the others followed Professor McGonagall upstairs and into her office. The sleet-spattered windows were rattling in their frames, and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate. Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the still sobbing Leanne. 
"Well?" she said sharply. "What happened?" 
Haltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying, Leanne told Professor McGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little odd, and 
how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome, there was no getting another word out of her. 
"All right," said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, "go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock." 
When she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 
"What happened when Katie touched the necklace?" 
"She rose up in the air," said Harry, before either Ron or Hermi-one could speak, "and then began to scream, and collapsed. Profes-sor, can I see Professor Dumbledore, please?" 
"The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter," said Professor McGonagall, looking surprised. 
"Away?" Harry repeated angrily. 
"Yes, Potter, away!" said Professor McGonagall tartly. "But any-thing you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me, I'm sure!" 
For a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor McGonagall did not invite confidences; Dumbledore, though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a life-and-death matter, though, and no moment to worry about being laughed at. 
"I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor." ; 
On one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embar-rassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry. 
"That is a very serious accusation, Potter," said Professor McGonagall, after a shocked pause. "Do you have any proof?" 
"No," said Harry, "but.. ." and he told her about following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had over-heard between him and Mr. Borgin. 
When he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused. 
"Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?" 
"No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didn't have it with him. But that's not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it was that necklace " 
"You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?" 
"No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him " 
"But Harry," Hermione interrupted, "Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said no " 
"Because he didn't want to touch it, obviously!" said Harry angrily. 
"What he actually said was, 'How would I look carrying that down the street?'" said Hermione. 
"Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace," inter-jected Ron. 
"Oh, Ron," said Hermione despairingly, "it would be all wrapped up, so he wouldn't have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street  and in any case," she pressed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt, "I asked Borgin about the necklace, don't you remember? When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn't say it was already sold or anything " 
"Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were up to within about five seconds, of course he wasn't going to tell you  anyway, Malfoy could've sent off for it since " 
"That's enough!" said Professor McGonagall, as Hermione opened her mouth to retort, looking furious. "Potter, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds of people " 
" that's what I said " muttered Ron. 
" and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year. I do not believe that necklace can possibly have en-tered this school without our knowledge " 
"But " 
" and what is more," said Professor McGonagall, with an air of awful finality, "Mr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today." 
Harry gaped at her, deflating. 
"How do you know, Professor?" 
"Because he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your suspicions, Potter," she said as she marched past them, "but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell. Good day to you all." 
She held open her office door. They had no choice but to file past her without another word. 
Harry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall; 
nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started dis-cussing what had happened. 
"So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to?" asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to the common room. 
"Goodness only knows," said Hermione. "But whoever it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace." 
"It could've been meant for loads of people," said Harry. "Dumbledore  the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or Slughorn  Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they can't be pleased that he's sided with Dumbledore. Or " 
"Or you," said Hermione, looking troubled. 
"Couldn't have been," said Harry, "or Katie would've just turned around in the lane and given it to me, wouldn't she? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?" 
"Harry, Malfoy wasn't in Hogsmeade!" said Hermione, actually stamping her foot in frustration. 
"He must have used an accomplice, then," said Harry. "Crabbe or Goyle  or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, he'll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he's joined up " 
Ron and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said There's no point arguing with him. 
"Dilligrout," said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady. 
The portrait swung open to admit them to the common room. It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, the news of Katie's fate had not yet spread. 
"It wasn't a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about it," said Ron, casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. "The curse didn't even make it into the castle. Not what you'd call foolproof." 
"You're right," said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again. "It wasn't very well thought-out at all." 
"But since when has Malfoy been one of the world's great thinkers?" asked Harry. 
Neither Ron nor Hermione answered him. 

Chapter 13: The secret riddle


Katie was removed to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school, though the details were confused and nobody other than Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself had not been the intended target. 
"Oh, and Malfoy knows, of course," said Harry to Ron and Hermione, who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever Harry mentioned his Malfoy-Is-a-Death-Eater theory. 
Harry had wondered whether Dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for Monday night's lesson, but having had no word to the contrary, he presented himself outside Dumbledore's office at eight o'clock, knocked, and was told to enter. There sat Dumbledore looking unusually tired; his hand was as black and burned as ever, but he smiled when he gestured to Harry to sit down. The Pensieve was sitting on the desk again, casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling. 
"You have had a busy time while I have been away," Dumbledore said. "I believe you witnessed Katie's accident." 
"Yes, sir. How is she?" 
"Still very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin; there was a tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she even held it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, perhaps instantly. Luckily Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse ?quot; 
"Why him?" asked Harry quickly. "Why not Madam Pomfrey?" 
"Impertinent," said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius's great-great-grandfather, raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping. "I would not have permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day." 
"Yes, thank you, Phineas," said Dumbledore quellingly. "Professor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, the St. Mungo's staff are sending me hourly reports, and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time." 
"Where were you this weekend, sir?" Harry asked, disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck, a feeling apparently shared by Phineas Nigellus, who hissed softly. 
"I would rather not say just now," said Dumbledore. "However, I shall tell you in due course." 
"You will?" said Harry, startled. 
"Yes, I expect so," said Dumbledore, withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand. 
"Sir," said Harry tentatively, "I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade." 
"Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with light-fingered contempt," said Dumbledore, frowning a little. "He has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me. However, rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of Sirius's old possessions." 
"That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black heirlooms?" said Phineas Nigellus, incensed; and he stalked out of his frame, undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld Place. 
"Professor," said Harry, after a short pause, "did Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt? About Draco Malfoy?" 
"She told me of your suspicions, yes," said Dumbledore. 
"And do you ??" 
"I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in Katie's accident," said Dumbledore. "But what concerns me now, Harry, is our lesson." 
Harry felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons were so very important, why had there been such a long gap between the first and second? However, he said no more about Draco Malfoy, but watched as Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his long-fingered hands. 
"You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord Voldemort's beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle, Tom Riddle, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in London, expecting the baby who would one day become Lord Voldemort." 
"How do you know she was in London, sir?" 
"Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke," said Dumbledore, "who, by an odd coincidence, helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing." 
He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him swill them before, much as a gold prospector sifts for gold. Up out of the swirling, silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the Pensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes. 
"Yes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was brought in by a young witch just before Christmas, oh, many years ago now. She said she needed the gold badly, well, that much was obvious. Covered in rags and pretty far along . . . Going to have a baby, see. She said the locket had been Slytherin's. Well, we hear that sort of story all the time, 'Oh, this was Merlin's, this was, his favorite teapot,' but when I looked at it, it had his mark all right, and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth. Of course, that made it near enough priceless. She didn't seem to have any idea how much it was worth. Happy to get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made!" 
Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come. 
"He only gave her ten Galleons?" said Harry indignantly. 
"Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity," said Dumbledore. "So we know that, near the end of her pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession, the locket that was one of Marvolo's treasured family heirlooms." 
"But she could do magic!" said Harry impatiently. "She could have got food and everything for herself by magic, couldn't she?" 
"Ah," said Dumbledore, "perhaps she could. But it is my beliefI am guessing again, but I am sure I am right ?that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen. In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life." 
"She wouldn't even stay alive for her son?" 
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. "Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?" 
"No," said Harry quickly, "but she had a choice, didn't she, not like my mother ?quot; 
"Your mother had a choice too," said Dumbledore gently. "Yes, Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her, but do not judge her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother's courage. And now, if you will stand ..." 
"Where are we going?" Harry asked, as Dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk. 
"This time," said Dumbledore, "we are going to enter my memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate. After you, Harry ..." 
Harry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again. . . . Seconds later, his feet hit firm ground; he opened his eyes and found that he and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, old-fashioned London street. 
"There I am," said Dumbledore brightly, pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horse-drawn milk cart. 
This younger Albus Dumbledore's long hair and beard were auburn. Having reached their side of the street, he strode off along the pavement, drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing. 
"Nice suit, sir," said Harry, before he could stop himself, but Dumbledore merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a short distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded by high railings. He mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked once. After a moment or two, the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron. 
"Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole, who, I believe, is the matron here?" 
"Oh," said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in Dumbledore's eccentric appearance. "Um. . . just a mo' . . . MRS. COLE!" she bellowed over her shoulder. 
Harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response. The girl turned back to Dumbledore. "Come in, she's on 'er way." 
Dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white; the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean. Harry and the older Dumbledore followed. Before the front door had closed behind them, a skinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying toward them. She had a sharp-featured face that appeared more anxious than unkind, and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward Dumbledore. 
". . . and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley's oozing all over his sheets ?chicken pox on top of everything else," she said to nobody in particular, and then her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold. 
"Good afternoon," said Dumbledore, holding out his hand. Mrs. Cole simply gaped. 
"My name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today." 
Mrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was not a hallucination, she said feebly, "Oh yes. Well ?well then ?you'd better come into my room. Yes." 
She led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room, part office. It was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched. She invited Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him nervously. 
"I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future," said Dumbledore. 
"Are you family?" asked Mrs. Cole. 
"No, I am a teacher," said Dumbledore. "I have come to offer Tom a place at my school." 
"What school's this, then?" 
"It is called Hogwarts," said Dumbledore. 
"And how come you're interested in Tom?" 
"We believe he has qualities we are looking for." 
"You mean he's won a scholarship? How can he have done? He's never been entered for one." 
"Well, his name has been down for our school since birth ?quot; 
"Who registered him? His parents?" 
There was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an inconveniently sharp woman. Apparently Dumbledore thought so too, for Harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs. Cole's desktop. 
"Here," said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper, "I think this will make everything clear." 
Mrs. Cole's eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment. 
"That seems perfectly in order," she said placidly, handing it back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before. 
"Er ?may I offer you a glass of gin?" she said in an extra-refined voice. 
"Thank you very much," said Dumbledore, beaming. 
It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she drained her own glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she smiled at Dumbledore for the first time, and he didn't hesitate to press his advantage. 
"I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddle's history? I think he was born here in the orphanage?" 
"That's right," said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more gin. "I remember it clear as anything, because I'd just started here myself. New Year's Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night. And this girl, not much older than I was myself at the time, came staggering up the front steps. Well, she wasn't the first. We took her in, and she had the baby within the hour. And she was dead in another hour." 
Mrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin. 
"Did she say anything before she died?" asked Dumbledore. "Anything about the boy's father, for instance?" 
"Now, as it happens, she did," said Mrs. Cole, who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now, with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story. "I remember she said to me, 'I hope he looks like his papa,' and I won't lie, she was right to hope it, because she was no beauty ?and then she told me he was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father ?yes, I know, funny name, isn't it? We wondered whether she came from a circus ?and she said the boy's surname was to be Riddle. And she died soon after that without another word. 
"Well, we named him just as she'd said, it seemed so important to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the orphanage and he's been here ever since." 
Mrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to another healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones. Then she said, "He's a funny boy." 
"Yes," said Dumbledore. "I thought he might be." 
"He was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you know. And then, when he got a little older, he was. . . odd." 
"Odd in what way?" asked Dumbledore gently. 
"Well, he ?quot; 
But Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot Dumbledore over her gin glass. 
"He's definitely got a place at your school, you say?" 
"Definitely," said Dumbledore. 
"And nothing I say can change that?" 
"Nothing," said Dumbledore. 
"You'll be taking him away, whatever?" 
"Whatever," repeated Dumbledore gravely. 
She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him. Apparently she decided she could, because she said in a sudden rush, "He scares the other children." 
"You mean he is a bully?" asked Dumbledore. 
"I think he must be," said Mrs. Cole, frowning slightly, "but it's very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents. . . . Nasty things ..." 
Dumbledore did not press her, though Harry could tell that he was interested. She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still. 
"Billy Stubbs's rabbit. . . well, Tom said he didn't do it and I don't see how he could have done, but even so, it didn't hang itself from the rafters, did it?" 
"I shouldn't think so, no," said Dumbledore quietly. 
"But I'm jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I know is he and Billy had argued the day before. And then" ?Mrs. Cole took another swig of gin, slopping a little over her chin this time ?"on the summer outing ?we take them out, you know, once a year, to the countryside or to the seaside ?well, Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite right afterwards, and all we ever got out of them was that they'd gone into a cave with Tom Riddle. He swore they'd just gone exploring, but something happened in there, I'm sure of it. And, well, there have been a lot of things, funny things. . . ." 
She looked around at Dumbledore again, and though her cheeks were flushed, her gaze was steady. "I don't think many people will be sorry to see the back of him." 
"You understand, I'm sure, that we will not be keeping him permanently?" said Dumbledore. "He will have to return here, at the very least, every summer." 
"Oh, well, that's better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker," said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup. She got to her feet, and Harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady, even though two-thirds of the gin was now gone. "I suppose you'd like to see him?" 
"Very much," said Dumbledore, rising too. 
She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed. The orphans, Harry saw, were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic. They looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up. 
"Here we are," said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor. She knocked twice and entered. 
"Tom? You've got a visitor. This is Mr. Dumberton ?sorry, Dunderbore. He's come to tell you ?well, I'll let him do it." 
Harry and the two Dumbledores entered the room, and Mrs. Cole closed the door on them. It was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe and an iron bedstead. A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets, his legs stretched out in front of him, holding a book. 
There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle's face. Merope had got her dying wish: He was his handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years old, dark-haired, and pale. His eyes narrowed slightly as he took in Dumbledore's eccentric appearance. There was a moment's silence. 
"How do you do, Tom?" said Dumbledore, walking forward and holding out his hand. 
The boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook hands. Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle, so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor. 
"I am Professor Dumbledore." 
"'Professor'?" repeated Riddle. He looked wary. "Is that like 'doctor'? What are you here for? Did she get you in to have a look at me?" 
He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just left. 
"No, no," said Dumbledore, smiling. 
"I don't believe you," said Riddle. "She wants me looked at, doesn't she? Tell the truth!" 
He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking. It was a command, and it sounded as though he had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, warier still. 
"Who are you?" 
"I have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts. I have come to offer you a place at my school ?your new school, if you would like to come." 
Riddle's reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the bed and backed away from Dumbledore, looking furious. 
"You can't kid me! The asylum, that's where you're from, isn't it? 'Professor,' yes, of course ?well, I'm not going, see? That old cat's the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to little Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, they'll tell you! 
"I am not from the asylum," said Dumbledore patiently. "I am a teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school, nobody will force you ?quot; 
"I'd like to see them try," sneered Riddle. 
"Hogwarts," Dumbledore went on, as though he had not heard Riddle's last words, "is a school for people with special abilities ?quot; 
"I'm not mad!" 
"I know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a school for mad people. It is a school of magic." 
There was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face expressionless, but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Dumbledore's, as though trying to catch one of them lying. 
"Magic?" he repeated in a whisper. 
"That's right," said Dumbledore. 
"It's. . . it's magic, what I can do?" 
"What is it that you can do?" 
"All sorts," breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked fevered. "I can make filings move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want them to do, without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I want to." 
His legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again, staring at his hands, his head bowed as though in prayer. 
"I knew I was different," he whispered to his own quivering fingers. "I knew I was special. Always, I knew there was something." 
"Well, you were quite right," said Dumbledore, who was no longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently. "You are a wizard." 
Riddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: There was a wild happiness upon it, yet for some reason it did not make him better looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher, his expression almost bestial. 
"Are you a wizard too?" 
"Yes, I am." 
"Prove it," said Riddle at once, in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said, "Tell the truth." 
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. "If, as I take it, you are accepting your place at Hogwarts?quot; 
"Of course I am!" 
"Then you will address me as 'Professor' or 'sir.'" 
Riddle's expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said, in an unrecognizably polite voice, "I'm sorry, sir. I meant ?please, Professor, could you show me ??" 
Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they were currently in a building full of Muggles and must therefore be cautious. To his great surprise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick. 
The wardrobe burst into flames. 
Riddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage; all his worldly possessions must be in there. But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged. 
Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, his expression greedy, he pointed at the wand. "Where can I get one of them?" 
"All in good time," said Dumbledore. "I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe." 
And sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from inside it. For the first time, Riddle looked frightened. 
"Open the door," said Dumbledore. 
Riddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare clothes, a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it. 
"Take it out," said Dumbledore. 
Riddle took down the quaking box. He looked unnerved. 
"Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have?" asked Dumbledore. 
Riddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating look. "Yes, I suppose so, sir," he said finally, in an expressionless voice. 
"Open it," said Dumbledore. 
Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them. Harry, who had expected something much more exciting, saw a mess of small, everyday objects: a yo-yo, a silver thimble, and a tarnished mouth organ among them. Once free of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets. 
"You will return them to their owners with your apologies," said Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand back into his jacket. "I shall know whether it has been done. And be warned: Thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts." 
Riddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last he said in a colorless voice, "Yes, sir." 
"At Hogwarts," Dumbledore went on, "we teach you not only to use magic, but to control it. You have ?inadvertently, I am sure ?been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow your magic to run away with you. But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students, and the Ministry of Magic ?yes, there is a Ministry ?will punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they abide by our laws." 
"Yes, sir," said Riddle again. 
It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box. When he had finished, he turned to Dumbledore and said baldly, "I haven't got any money." 
"That is easily remedied," said Dumbledore, drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket. "There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but ?quot; 
"Where do you buy spellbooks?" interrupted Riddle, who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat gold Galleon, 
"In Diagon Alley," said Dumbledore. "I have your list of books and school equipment with me. I can help you find everything ?quot; 
"You're coming with me?" asked Riddle, looking up. 
"Certainly, if you ?quot; 
"I don't need you," said Riddle. "I'm used to doing things for myself, I go round London on my own all the time. How do you get to this Diagon Alley ?sir?" he added, catching Dumbledore's eye. 
Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle, but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment, and after telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage, he said, "You will be able to see it, although Muggles around you ?non-magical people, that is ?will not. Ask for Tom the barman ?easy enough to remember, as he shares your name ?quot; 
Riddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an irksome fly. 
"You dislike the name 'Tom'?" 
"There are a lot of Toms," muttered Riddle. Then, as though he could not suppress the question, as though it burst from him in spite of himself, he asked, "Was my father a wizard? He was called Tom Riddle too, they've told me." 
"I'm afraid I don't know," said Dumbledore, his voice gentle. 
"My mother can't have been magic, or she wouldn't have died," said Riddle, more to himself than Dumbledore. "It must've been him. So ?when I've got all my stuff?when do I come to this Hogwarts?" 
"All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope," said Dumbledore. "You will leave from King's Cross Station on the first of September. There is a train ticket in there too." 
Riddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again. Taking it, Riddle said, "I can speak to snakes. I found out when we've been to the country on trips ?they find me, they whisper to me. Is that normal for a wizard?" 
Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment, determined to impress. 
"It is unusual," said Dumbledore, after a moment's hesitation, "but not unheard of." 
His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddle's face. They stood for a moment, man and boy, staring at each other. Then the handshake was broken; Dumbledore was at the door. 
"Good-bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts." 
"I think that will do," said the white-haired Dumbledore at Harry's side, and seconds later, they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more, before landing squarely in the present-day office. 
"Sit down," said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry. 
Harry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen. 
"He believed it much quicker than I did ?I mean, when you told him he was a wizard," said Harry. "I didn't believe Hagrid at first, when he told me." 
"Yes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was ?to use his word ?'special,'" said Dumbledore. 
"Did you know ?then?" asked Harry. 
"Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time?" said Dumbledore. "No, I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for others' sake as much as his. 
"His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well-developed for such a young wizard and ?most interestingly and ominously of all ?he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and begun to use them consciously. And as you saw, they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards: He was already using magic against other people, to frighten, to punish, to control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive. . . . 'I can make them hurt if I want to. . . .'" 
"And he was a Parselmouth," interjected Harry. 
"Yes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts, although as we know, there are Parselmouths among the great and the good too. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination. 
"Time is making fools of us again," said Dumbledore, indicating the dark sky beyond the windows. "But before we part, I want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed, for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings. 
"Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle's reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name, 'Tom'?" 
Harry nodded. 
"There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people, anything that made him ordinary. Even then, he wished to be different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as you know, within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of Lord Voldemort' behind which he has been hidden for so long. 
"I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly self-sufficient, secretive, and, apparently, friendless? He did not want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one. 
"And lastly ?I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry ?the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. These were taken from victims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind this magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will be important later. 
"And now, it really is time for bed." 
Harry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell I upon the little table on which Marvolo Gaunt's ring had rested last I time, but the ring was no longer there. 
"Yes, Harry?" said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt. I 
"The ring's gone," said Harry, looking around. "But I thought I you might have the mouth organ or something." 
Dumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of his hall' moon spectacles. 
"Very astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ." 
And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who understood himself to be dismissed. 

Chapter 14: Felix felicis 


Harry had Herbology first thing the following morning. He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being over-heard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. The weekends brutal wind had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse. 
"Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who," said Ron qui-etly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this terms project, and began pulling on their protective gloves. "But I still don't get why Dumbledore's showing you all this. I mean, it's really interesting and everything, but what's the point?" 
"Dunno," said Harry, inserting a gum shield. "But he says its all important and it'll help me survive." 
"I think it's fascinating," said Hermione earnestly. "It makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How else will you find out his weaknesses?" 
"So how was Slughorn's latest party?" Harry asked her thickly through the gum shield. 
"Oh, it was quite fun, really," said Hermione, now putting on protective goggles. "I mean, he drones on about famous exploits a bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he's so well connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones." 
"Gwenog Jones?" said Ron, his eyes widening under his own goggles. "The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?" 
"That's right," said Hermione. "Personally, I thought she was a bit full of herself, but " 
"Quite enough chat over here!" said Professor Sprout briskly, bustling over and looking stern. "You're lagging behind, everybody else has started, and Neville's already got his first pod!" 
They looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit. 
"Okay, Professor, we're starting now!" said Ron, adding quietly, when she had turned away again, "should ve used Muffliato, Harry." 
"No, we shouldn't!" said Hermione at once, looking, as she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince and his spells. "Well, come on ... we'd better get going. ..." 
She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them. 
It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air. One tangled itself in Hermione's hair, and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs; Harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branches; Hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and Hermi-one snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like Neville's. At once, the prickly vines shot back inside, and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood. 
"You know, I don't think I'll be having any of these in my garden when I've got my own place," said Ron, pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face. 
"Pass me a bowl," said Hermione, holding the pulsating pod at arm's length; Harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face. 
"Don't be squeamish, squeeze it out, they're best when they're fresh!" called Professor Sprout. 
"Anyway," said Hermione, continuing their interrupted conver-sation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, "Slughorn's going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and there's no way you'll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come." 
Harry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, "And this is another party just for Slughorn's favorites, is it?" 
"Just for the Slug Club, yes," said Hermione. 
The pod flew out from under Ron's fingers and hit the green house glass, rebounding onto the back of Professor Sprout's head and knocking off her old, patched hat. Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, "Look, I didn't make up the name 'Slug Club' " 
"'Slug Club,'"repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy. "It's pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don't you try hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug " 
"We're allowed to bring guests," said Hermione, who for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, "and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think it's that stupid then I won't bother!" 
Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther, so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them. Unno-ticed by either, he seized the bowl that contained the pod and be-gan to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every word of their conversation. 
"You were going to ask me?" asked Ron, in a completely differ-ent voice. 
"Yes," said Hermione angrily. "But obviously if you'd rather 1 hooked up with McLaggen ..." 
There was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel. 
"No, I wouldn't," said Ron, in a very quiet voice. 
Harry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it. 
"Reparo,"' he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together again. The crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harry's presence. Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself. 
"Hand that over, Harry," said Hermione hurriedly. "It says we're supposed to puncture them with something sharp. . . ." 
Harry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the stump. It was not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry, as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him; he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. But he was not sure how he felt about it. ... He and Cho were now too em-barrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. And then, what if they didn't split up? What if they became like Bill and Fleur, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good? 
"Gotcha!" yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just as Hermione managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms. 
The rest of the lesson passed without further mention of Slughorn's party. Although Harry watched his two friends more closely over the next few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual. Harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what 
happened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughorn's dimly lit room on the night of the party. In the meantime, however, he had more pressing worries. 
Katie Bell was still in St. Mungo's Hospital with no prospect of leaving, which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser short. He kept putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would return, but their opening match against Slytherin was loom-ing, and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play. 
Harry did not think he could stand another full-House tryout. With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cor-nered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day. Most of the class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room, all of Hermione's creation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air. 
"Are you still interested in playing Chaser?" 
"Wha  ? Yeah, of course!" said Dean excitedly. Over Deans shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnegan slamming his books into his bag, looking sour. One of the reasons why Harry would have pre-ferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do what was best for the team, and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts. 
"Well then, you're in," said Harry. "There's a practice tonight, seven o'clock." 
"Right," said Dean. "Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can't wait to tell Ginny!" 
He sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone together, an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on Seamus's head as one of Hermione's canaries whizzed over them. 
Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katies substitute. There was much muttering in the common room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his class-mates for the team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. If they lost. . . well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse mutterings. . . . 
Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly that evening; he worked well with Ginny and Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time. The only problem was Ron. 
Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortu-nately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, his technique became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the mouth. 
"It was an accident, I'm sorry, Demelza, really sorry!" Ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground, dripping blood everywhere. "I just " 
"Panicked," Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip. "You prat, Ron, look at the state of her!" 
"I can fix that," said Harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing his wand at Demelzas mouth, and saying "Episkey." "And Ginny, don't call Ron a prat, you're not the Captain of this team " 
"Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should " 
Harry forced himself not to laugh. 
"In the air, everyone, let's go. . . ." 
Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term, though Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they were this close to the match. 
"Good work, everyone, I think we'll flatten Slytherin," he said bracingly, and the Chasers and Beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves. 
"I played like a sack of dragon dung," said Ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind Ginny. 
"No, you didn't," said Harry firmly. "You're the best Keeper I tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves." 
He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle, and by the time they reached the second floor, Ron was looking marginally more cheerful. When Harry pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, however, they found themselves looking at Dean and Ginny, who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together. 
It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Harry's stomach, clawing at his insides: Hot blood seemed to flood his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness, he heard Ron's voice as though from a great distance away. 
Oi! 
Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked around. "What?" said Ginny. 
"I don't want to find my own sister snogging people in public!" "This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!" said Ginny. 
Dean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a shifty grin that Harry did not return, as the newborn monster inside him was roar-ing for Dean's instant dismissal from the team. 
"Er . . . c'mon, Ginny," said Dean, "let's go back to the common room. ..." 
"You go!" said Ginny. "I want a word with my dear brother!" Dean left, looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene. 
"Right," said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at Ron, "let's get this straight once and for all. It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron " "Yeah, it is!" said Ron, just as angrily. "D' you think I want peo-ple saying my sister's a " 
"A what?" shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. "A what, exactly?" "He doesn't mean anything, Ginny " said Harry automati-cally, though the monster was roaring its approval of Ron's words. "Oh yes he does!" she said, flaring up at Harry. "Just because he's never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss he's ever had is from our Auntie Muriel " 
"Shut your mouth!" bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turning maroon. 
"No, I will not!" yelled Ginny, beside herself. "I've seen you with Phlegm, hoping she'll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her, it's pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done your self, you wouldn't mind so much that everyone else does it!" 
Ron had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped swiftly between them. 
"You don't know what you're talking about!" Ron roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginny around Harry, who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched. "Just because I don't do it in public  !" 
Ginny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out of the way. 
"Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow?" You  
A streak of orange light flew under Harrys left arm and missed Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up against the wall. 
"Don't be stupid " 
"Harry's snogged Cho Chang!" shouted Ginny, who sounded close to tears now. "And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it's only you who acts like it's something disgusting, Ron, and that's because you've got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!" 
And with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron; the look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breath-ing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Rich's cat, appeared around the cor-ner, which broke the tension. 
"C'mon," said Harry, as the sound of Filch's shuffling feet reached their ears. 
They hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor. "Oi, out of the way!" Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn. 
Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt dis-oriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this. It's just because she's Rons sister, he told himself. You just didn't like seeing her kissing Dean because she's Ron's sister. . . . 
But unbidden into his mind came an image of that same de-serted corridor with himself kissing Ginny instead. . . . The mon-ster in his chest purred . . . but then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like "betrayal of trust" . . . "supposed to be my friend" . . . 
"D'you think Hermione did snog Krum?" Ron asked abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady. Harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in which he and Ginny were quite alone  "What?" he said confusedly. "Oh ... er ..." The honest answer was "yes," but he did not want to give it. However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harry's face. 
"Dilligrout," he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room. 
Neither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in si-lence, each absorbed in his own thoughts, 
Harry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elder-brotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron, and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He had known Ginny for years now. ... It was natural that he should feel protective . . . natural that he should want to look out for her . . . want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing her... No ... he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling. . . . 
Ron gave a great grunting snore. 
She's Ron's sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ron's sister. She's out-of-bounds. He would not risk his friendship with Ron for anything. He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny. 
Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beaters bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference. What was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast-Ended Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boys' dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him. 
To Harrys dismay, Ron's new aggression did not wear off over the next few days. Worse still, it coincided with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during the final Quidditch practice before Saturdays match, he failed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears. 
"You shut up and leave her alone!" shouted Peakes, who was about two-thirds Ron's height, though admittedly carrying a heavy bat. 
"ENOUGH!" bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny glowering in Rons direction and, remembering her reputation as an accom-plished caster of the Bat-Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene be-fore things got out of hand. "Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well today, Ron . . ." he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it, "you're my best mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this and I'm going to kick you off the team." 
He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then something much worse happened: Ron seemed to sag on his broom. all the fight went out of him and he said, "I resign. I'm pathetic." 
"You're not pathetic and you're not resigning!" said Harry fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. "You can save any-thing when you're on form, it's a mental problem you've got!" "You calling me mental?" "Yeah, maybe I am!" 
They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his head wearily. "I know you haven't got any time to find another Keeper, so I'll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, I'm tak-ing myself off the team." 
Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting Ron's confidence all through dinner, but Ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice. Harry persisted in the common room that evening, but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting him nasty looks. Finally Harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever. 
Harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. He did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Cap-tain, but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances of winning were very slim. . . . 
If only there was something he could do to make Ron pull him-self together . . . make him play at the top of his form . . . some-thing that would ensure that Ron had a really good day. . . . 
And the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of inspiration. 
Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear, pale blue sky: a good omen. 
The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as Harry and Ron approached. Harry grinned and waved; Ron gri-maced weakly and shook his head. 
"Cheer up, Ron!" called Lavender. "I know you'll be brilliant!" : Ron ignored her. 
"Tea?" Harry asked him. "Coffee? Pumpkin juice?" "Anything," said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast. 
A few minutes later Hermione, who had become so tired of Ron's recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them, paused on her way up the table. 
"How are you both feeling?" she asked tentatively, her eyes on the back of Ron's head. 
"Fine," said Harry, who was concentrating on handing Ron a glass of pumpkin juice. "There you go, Ron. Drink up." 
Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke 
sharply. 
"Don't drink that, Ron!" 
Both Harry and Ron looked up at her. 
"Why not?" said Ron. 
Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not be-lieve her eyes. 
"You just put something in that drink." 
"Excuse me?" said Harry. 
"You heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something into Ron's drink. You've got the bottle in your hand right now!" 
"I dont know what you're talking about," said Harry, stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket. 
"Ron, I warn you, don't drink it!" Hermione said again, alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained it in one gulp, and said, "Stop bossing me around, Hermione." 
She looked scandalized. Bending low so that only Harry could hear her, she hissed, "You should be expelled for that. I'd never have believed it of you, Harry!" 
"Look who's talking," he whispered back. "Confunded anyone lately?" 
She stormed up the table away from them. Harry watched her go without regret. Hermione had never really understood what a serious business Quidditch was. He then looked around at Ron, who was smacking his lips. 
"Nearly time/' said Harry blithely. 
The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium. 
"Pretty lucky the weathers this good, eh?" Harry asked Ron. 
"Yeah," said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking. 
Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room. 
"Conditions look ideal," said Ginny, ignoring Ron. "And guess what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey  he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice, and he's too sore to play! And even better than that  Malfoy's gone off sick too!" 
"What?" said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. "He's ill? What's wrong with him?" 
"No idea, but it's great for us," said Ginny brightly. "They're playing Harper instead; he's in my year and he's an idiot." 
Harry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch. Malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better. Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on? Was he really ill, or was he faking? 
"Fishy, isn't it?" he said in an undertone to Ron. "Malfoy not playing?" 
"Lucky, I call it," said Ron, looking slightly more animated. "And Vaisey off too, he's their best goal scorer, I didn't fancy  hey!" he said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his Keepers gloves and staring at Harry. 
"What?" 
"I... you . . ." Ron had dropped his voice, he looked both scared and excited. "My drink ... my pumpkin juice ... you didn't...?" 
Harry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, "We'll be starting in about five minutes, you'd better get your boots on." 
They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos. One end of the stadium was solid red and gold; the other, a sea of green and silver. Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too: Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood's famous lion-topped hat. 
Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was stand-ing ready to release the balls from the crate. 
"Captains shake hands," she said, and Harry had his hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart. "Mount your brooms. On the whistle . . . three . . . two . . . one . . ." 
The whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground, and they were away. 
Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was zigzagging far below him. Then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual commentator's started up. 
"Well, there they go, and I think we're all surprised to see the team that Potter's put together this year. Many thought, given Ronald Weasley's patchy performance as Keeper last year, that he might be off the team, but of course, a close personal friendship with the Captain does help. . . ." 
These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned around on his broom to look toward the commentator's podium. A call, skinny blond buy with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan's; Harry recognized Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked. 
"Oh, and here comes Slytherin's first attempt on goal, it's Urquhart streaking down the pitch and " 
Harrys stomach turned over. 
" Weasley saves it, well, he's bound to get lucky sometimes, I suppose. . . ." 
"That's right, Smith, he is," muttered Harry, grinning to him-self, as he dived amongst the Chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive Snitch. 
With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero, Ron having made some truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindor's six goals. This effectively stopped Zacharias won-dering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because Harry liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead. 
"Of course, Coote isn't really the usual build for a Beater," said Zacharias loftily, "they've generally got a bit more muscle " 
"Hit a Bludger at him!" Harry called to Coote as he zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite direc-tion. Harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the Bludger had found its mark. 
It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. Again and again they scored, and again and again, at the other end of the pitch, Ron saved goals with apparent ease. He was actually smiling now, and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a 
rousing chorus of the old favorite "Weasley Is Our King," he pre-tended to conduct them from on high. 
"Thinks he's something special today, doesn't he?" said a snide voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately. "Your blood-traitor pal..." Madam Hooch's back was turned, and though Gryffindors be-low shouted in anger, by the time she looked around, Harper had already sped off. His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, de-termined to ram him back. ... 
"And I think Harper of Slytherin's seen the Snitch!" said Zacharias Smith through his megaphone. "Yes, he's certainly seen something Potter hasn't!" 
Smith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn't he noticed them collide? But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the , sky  Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky. 
Harry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of Smith's commentary or the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of him, and Gryffindor was only a hundred points up; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost. . . and now Harper was feet from it, his hand outstretched. ... 
"Oi, Harper!" yelled Harry in desperation. "How much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?" 
He did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a dou-ble-take; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip through his fingers, and shot right past it. Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and caught it. 
"YES!" Hairy yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled back toward the ground, the Snitch held high in his hand. As the crowd realized what had happened, a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game. 
"Ginny, where're you going?" yelled Harry, who had found hint self trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of tin1 team, but Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she collided with the commentators podium. As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring,: Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, "Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry." 
Laughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginny, but let go very quickly. Avoiding her gaze, he clapped cheering Ron on the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the Gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm, punching the air ami waving to their supporters. 
The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant. "Party up in the common room, Seamus said!" yelled Dean exuberantly. "C'mon, Ginny, Demelza!" 
Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing room. They were just about to leave when Hermione entered. She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined. "I want a word with you, Harry." She took a deep breath. "Yon shouldn't have done it. You heard Slughorn, its illegal." "What are you going to do, turn us in?" demanded Ron. "What are you two talking about?" asked Harry, turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning, "You know perfectly well what we're talking about!" said Hermione shrilly. "You spiked Rons juice with lucky potion at breakfast! I'elix Felicis!" 
"No, I didn't," said Harry, turning back to face them both. 
"Yes you did, Harry, and that's why everything went right, there were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything!" 
"I didn't put it in!" said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. "I wanted Ron to think I'd done it, so I faked it when I knew you were look-ing." He looked at Ron. "You saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself." 
He pocketed the potion again. 
"There really wasn't anything in my pumpkin juice?" Ron said, astounded. "But the weather's good. . . and Vaisey couldn't play. ... I honestly haven't been given lucky potion?" ] 
Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on Hermione, imitating her voice. "You added Felix Felicis to Rons juice this morning, that's why he saved everything! See! I can save goals without help, Hermione!" 
"I never said you couldn't  Ron, you thought you'd been given it too!" 
But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder. 
"Er," said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his plan to backfire like this, "shall. . . shall we go up to the party, then?" 
"You go!" said Hermione, blinking back tears. "I'm sick of Ron at the moment, I don't know what I'm supposed to have done. . . ." 
And she stormed out of the changing room too. 
Harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at him, but he felt a great sense of letdown; he had been sure that if Ron won the match, he and Hermione would be friends again immediately. He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermi-one that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offense had occurred so long ago. 
Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party, which was in full swing when he arrived. Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him. What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find Ron. At last, he extricated him-self from Romilda Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to Slughorn's Christmas party with him. As he was duck-ing toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels. 
"Looking for Ron?" she asked, smirking. "He's over there, the filthy hypocrite." 
Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose. 
"It looks like he's eating her face, doesn't it?" said Ginny dispas-sionately. "But I suppose he's got to refine his technique somehow. Good game, Harry." 
She patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach, but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer. Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold. 
Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whip-ping out of sight. 
He darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, and pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The corridor outside , seemed to be deserted. 
"Hermione?" 
He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was sitting on the teacher's desk, alone except for a small ring of twit-tering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spell-work at a time like this. 
"Oh, hello, Harry," she said in a brittle voice. "I was just practicing." 
"Yeah . . . they're  er  really good. ..." said Harry. 
He had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron, that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, "Ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations." 
"Er . . . does he?" said Harry. 
"Don't pretend you didn't see him," said Hermione. "He wasn't exactly hiding it, was  ?" 
The door behind them burst open. To Harry's horror, Ron came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand. ; ' 
"Oh," he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and Hermione. 
"Oops!" said Lavender, and she backed out of the room, gig-gling. The door swung shut behind her. 
There was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, "Hi, Harry! Wondered where you'd got to!" 
Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds con-tinued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system. 
"You shouldn't leave Lavender waiting outside," she said quietly. "She'll wonder where you've gone." 
She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Harry glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened. 
"Oppugno!" came a shriek from the doorway. 
Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach. 
"Gerremoffme!" he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it. Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed. 

Chapter 15: The Unbreakable Vow
Snow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve C hristmas trees to the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunat e ly, however, Harry's frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle's secret passageways, so that he was often, without too much difficulty, to naviga t e mistletoe-free routes between classes. 
  
Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again. 

Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermione's bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone. 
  
"She can't complain," he told Harry. "She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, it's a free country. I haven't done anything wrong." 
  
Harry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning (Quintessence: A Q uest). Determined as he was to remain friends with both Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight. 
  
"I never promised Hermione anything , " Ron mumbled. "I mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn's Christmas party with her, but she never said... just as friends... I'm a free agent..." 
  
Harry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him. Ron's voice trailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the words "Krum" and "Can't complain" again. 
  
Hermione's schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, So Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers. 
  
"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes," said Hermione, while the librarian , Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind them. "I really couldn't care less." 
  
She raised her quill and dotted an 'i' so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry said nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish from the lack of use. He bent a little lower over Advanced Potion-Making and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the p rince's useful additions to Libatius B orage's text. 
  
"And incidentally," said Hermione, after a few moments, "you need to be careful." 
  
"For the last time," said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse tone after three-quarters of an ho u r of silence, "I am not giving back this book . I've learned more from the Half-blood p rince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in--" 
  
"I'm not talking about your stupid so-called prince," said Hermione , giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. "I'm talki ng about earlier. I went into the girl's bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane , trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. They're all hoping they're going to get you to take them to Slughorn's party, and thay all seem to have bought Fred and George's love potions, which I'm afraid to say probably work --" 
  
"Why didn't you confiscate them then?" demanded Harry, it seemed extraordinary that Hermione's m ania for upholding the rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture. 
  
"They didn't have the potions with them in the bathroom," said Hermione scornfully, "They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt the Half-blood prince" she gave the book another scornful look "could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, I'd just invite someone to go with you, that'll stop all the others thinking they've still got a chance. It's tomor r ow night, they're getting desperate." 
  
"There isn't anyone I want to invite," mumbled Harry, who was still not trying to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency. 
  
"Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Va ne looked like she meant business." said Hermione grimly. 
  
She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithma n cy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill. Harry wa t che d her with his mind a long way away. 
  
"Hang on a moment," he said slowly. "I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes?" 
  
"And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned?" asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay. 
  
"But I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come these grils are able to bring love potions into the school?" 
  
"Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions," said Hermione. "It's part of their Owl order service."

"You know a lot about it." 
  
Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. 
  
"It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer," she said coldly, "I don't go around putting potions in people's drinks... or pretending too eit h er, which is just as bad..." 
  
"Yeah, well, never mind that," said Harry quickly. "The point is, Filch is being fooled isn't he? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else! So why couldn't Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school --?" 
  
"Oh, Harry... not that again..." 
  
"Come on, why not?" demanded Harry. 
  
"Look , " sighed Hermione, "Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don't they? They're used to find d ark magic and d ark obje c ts. They'd have picked up a powerful curse , like the one in the necklace, withi n seconds. But something that's just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn ' t register -- anyway Love potions aren't d ark or dangerous ---" 
  
"Easy for you to say," muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane. 
  
"-- so it would be down to Filch to realise it wasn't a cough potion, and he's not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from --" 
  
Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying. 
  
"The library is now closed," she said, "Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct -- what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?"
  
"It isn't the library's, it's mine!" said Harry hastily, snatching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand. 
  
" Spoiled!" she hissed . "Desecrated, befouled !" 
  
"It's just a book that's been written on!" said Harry, tugging it out of her grip. 
  
She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away. 
  
"She'll ban you from the library if you're not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book?" 
  
"It's not my fault she's barking mad, Hermione. Or d'you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I've always thought there might be something between them..." 
  
"Oh, ha ha.." 

Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing w hether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other. 
  
"Baubles" said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive password. 
  
"Same to you," said the fat lady with a roguish grin, and she swung forward to admit them. 

"Hi, Harry!" said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole. "Fancy a gillywater?" 
  
Hermione gave him a "what-did-I-tell-you?" look over her shoulder. 
  
"No thanks," said Harry quickly. "I don't like it much." 
  
"Well, take these anyway," said Romilda, thrusting a box into his hands. "Chocolate Cauldrons, they've got firewhiskey in them. My gran sent them to me, but I don't like them." 
  
"Oh-- right -- thanks a lot." said Harry, who could not think what else to say. " Er-- I ' m just going over here with ..." 
  
He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly. 
  
"Told you," said Hermione succinctly, " Sooner you ask someone, sooner they'll all leave you alone and you can --" 
  
But her face suddnly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and Lavender, who were i ntertwined in the same armchair. 
  
"Well, good night, Harry" said Hermione, though it was only seven o'clock in the evening, and she left for the girl s' dormitory without another word. 
  
Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn's party, after which he and Ron would depart together for the B urrow. It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their behavior... 
  
But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration; working in front of mirrors , they were suposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Profe s sor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron's just now, scooped up her remaining po ssessions and followed her. 
  
He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girl's bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back. 
  
"Oh, hello, Harry , " said Luna . " D id you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?" 
  
"Hi, Luna. Hermione , you left your stuff..." 

He held out her books.

"Oh, yes," said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact she was wiping her eyes with her pencil case. "Thank you , Harry. Well, I'd better get going..." 
  
And she hurried off, without ever giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any. 
  
"She's a bit upset , " said Luna. "I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about Ron Weasley..." 
  
"Yeah, they've had a row," said Harry. 
  
"He says funny things sometimes, doesn't he?" said Luna as they set off down the corridor together. "But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year." 
  
" I s'pose , " said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. "So have you had a good term?" 
  
"Oh, it's been al l right," said Luna. " A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny's been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me 'Loony' the other day --" 
  
"How would you like to come to S lughorn's party with me tonight?" 
  
The words were out of Harry's mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking. 
  
Luna turned her protuberant eyes to him in surprise. 
  
"Slughorn's party? With you?"

"Yeah," said Harry, "We're supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like.. I mean..." He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. " I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don't want to..." 

He was already half hoping that she didn't want to. 
  
"O h no, I'd love to go with you as friends!" said Luna, beaming as he had never seen her beam before. "Nobody's ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I dye mine too?"

"No" said Harry firmly, "That was a mistake. I'll get Hermione to put it right for me. So I'll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o'clock then . " 
  
"AHA!" screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them. 
  
"Potty asked Loony to go to the part y ! Potty lurves Loony! Potty luuuuuurves Looooony!" 
And he zoomed away cackling and shrieking, "Potty loves Loony!" 
"Nice to keep these things private," said Harry. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn's party. 
"You could've taken anyone!" said Ron in disbelief over dinner. "Anyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood?" 
  
"Don't call her that, Ron!" snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends. "I'm really glad you're taking her Harry, she's so excited." 
  
And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively. 
  
"You could say sorry , " suggested Harry bluntly. 
"What , and get attacked by another flock of canaries?" muttered Ron. 
"What did you have to imitate her for?" 
"She laughed at my mustache!" 
"So did I, it was the stupidest thing I've ever seen." 
  
But Ron did not seem to have he a rd; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron's neck. 
  
"Hi, Harry," said Parvati who, like Harry, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends. 
  
"Hi," said Harry, "How're you? You're staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave." 
  
"I managed to talk them out o f it for the time being," said Parvati. "That Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn't been anything since... Oh, hi, Hermione!" 
  
Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes. 
  
"Hi, Parvati!" said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. "Are you going to Slughorn's party tonight?" 
  
"No invite," said Parvati gloomily. "I'd love to go, though, it sounds like it's going to be really good... You're going, aren't you?" 
  
"Yes, I'm meeting Cormac at eight, and we're -" 
  
There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink , and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything. 
  
"- we're going up to the party together." 
  
"Cormac?" said Parvati. "Cormac McLaggen, you mean?" 
  
"That's right," said Hermione sweetly. "The one who *almost*" - she put a great deal of emphasis on the word - "bec a me Gryffindor Keeper." 
  
"Are you going out with him, then?" asked Parvati, wide-eyed. 
  
"Oh - yes - didn't you know?" said Harmione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle. 
  
"No!" said Parvati, looking positively agog at thi s piece of gossip. "Wow , you like your Quidditch players, don't you? First Krum, then McLaggen. . ." 
  
"I like *really good* Quidditch players," Hermione corrected her, still smiling. "Well, see you... Got to go and get ready for the party..." 
  
She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge. 
  
When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o'clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs. 
  
"Hi," he said. "Shall we get going then?" 
  
"Oh yes," she said happily. "Where is the party?" 
  
"Slughorn's office," said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. "Did you hear, there's supposed to be a vampire coming?" 
  
"Rufus Scrimgeour?" asked Luna. 
  
"I - what?" said Harry, disconcerted. "You mean the Minister of Magic?" 
  
"Yes, he's a vampire," said Luna matter-of-factly. "Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn't want the truth to get out!" 
  
Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her father's bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Slughorn's office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took. 
  
Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn's office was much larger than the usual teacher's study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson , and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables. 
  
"Harry, m'boy!" boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. "Come in, come in, so many people I'd like you to meet!" 
  
Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. Gripping Harry's arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Luna's hand and dragged her along with him. 
  
"Harry, I'd like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of ' Blood Brothers: My L ife Amongst the Vampires' - and, of course, his friend Sanguini." 
  
Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harry's hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited. 
"Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!" said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into Harry's face. "I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, 'Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting?'" 
  
"Er," said Harry, "were you?" 
  
"Just as modest as Horace described!" said Worple. "But seri-ously"  his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike  "I would be delighted to write it myself people are craving to know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months. And all with very little effort on your part, I assure you  ask Sanguini here if it isn't quite  Sanguini, stay here!" added Worple, suddenly stern, for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a rather hungry look in his eye. "Here, have a pasty," said Worple, seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguini's hand before turning his attention back to Harry. "My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea " 
  
"I'm definitely not interested," said Harry firmly, "and I've just seen a friend of mine, sorry." He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters. 
  
"Hermione! Hermione !" 
  
"Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna !" 
  
"What's happened to you?" asked Harry, for Hermione looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil's Snare. 
  
"Oh, I've just escaped  I mean, I've just left Cormac," she said. "Under the mistletoe," she added in explanation, as Harry continued to look questioningly at her. 
  
"Serves you right for coming with him," he told her severely. "I thought he'd annoy Ron most," said Hermione dispassion-ately. "I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole " 
  
"You considered Smith?" said Harry, revoked. 
  
"Yes, I did, and I'm starting to wish I'd chosen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let's go this way, we'll be able to see him coming, he's so tall. . . ." The three of them made their way over to the other side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone. 
  
"Hello," said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney. 
  
"Good evening, my dear," said Professor Trelawney, focusing upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could smell cooking sherry again. "I haven't seen you in my classes lately. .." 
  
"No, I've got Firenze this year," said Luna. 
  
"Oh, of course," said Professor Trelawney with an angry, drunken titter. "Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no ... we share classes. . . . It's an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you know. . ." Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry. 
  
Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione and said, "Let ' s get something straight. Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?" 
  
Hermione raised her eyebrows. "Do you really think I'd stoop that low?" 
  
-=-Harry looked at her shrewdly. "Hermione, if you can ask 0111 McLaggen " 
  
"There's a difference," said Hermione with dignity. "I've got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts." 
  
"Good," said Harry fervently. "Because he'll just fall apart again, and we'll lose the next match " 
  
"Quidditch!" said Hermione angrily. "Is that all boys care about? Cormac hasn't asked me one single question about myself, no, I've just been treated to 'A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen' nonstop ever since  oh no, here he comes!" She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished. 
  
"Seen Hermione?" asked McLaggen, forcing his way through the throng a minute later. 
  
"No, sorry," said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna's conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking. 
  
"Harry Potter!" said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time. 
  
"Oh, hello," said Harry unenthusiastically. 
  
"My dear boy!" she said in a very carrying whisper. "The rumors! The stories! 'The Chosen One'! Of course, I have known for a very long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . But why have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!" 
  
"Ah, Sybi l l, we all think our subject's most important!" said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney s other side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. "But I don't t hink I've ever known such a natural at Potions!" said Slughorn, re-garding Harry with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. "Instinctive, you know  like his mother! I've only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybi l l  why even Severus " And to Harry's horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them. "Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!" hiccuped Slughorn happily. "I was just talking about Harry's exceptional po-tion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!" 
  
Trapped, with Slughorns arm around his shoulders, Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed. "Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all." 
  
"Well, then, it's natural ability!" shouted Slughorn. "You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death  never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don't think even you, Severus " 
  
"Really?" said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions. 
  
"Remind me what other subjects you're taking, Harry?" asked Slughorn . 
  
"Defense Against the D ark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration , Herbology..." 
  
"All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror ," said Snap e with the faintest sneer. 
  
"Yeah, well, that's what I'd like to do," said Harry defiantly. 
  
"And a great one you'll make too!" boomed Slughorn. 
  
"I don't think you should be an Auror, Harry," said Luna unex pectedly. Everybody looked at her. "The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They're planning to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a c om bination of Dark Magic and gum disease." 
  
Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to lau gh. Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging, from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malf o y being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch. 
  
"Professor Slughorn," wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes, "I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an invitation?" 
  
Malfoy pulled himself free of Filchs grip, looking furious. "All right, I wasn't invited!" he said angrily. "I was trying to gate crash, happy?" 
  
"No, I'm not!" said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face. "You're in trouble, you are! Didn't the headma ster say that nighttime prowling ' s out, unless you've got permission, didn't he, eh?" 
  
-=-"That's all right, Argus, that's all right," said Slughorn, waving it 1.1 nd. "It's Christmas, and it's not a crime to want to come to a party . Just this once, we'll forget any punishment; you may stay , Draco. 
  
Fil ich's expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly pre di c t able; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Mal-foy as though both angry and . . . was it p ossible? ... a lit tl afraid? But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy h ad composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, and Snape's face was smoothly inscrutable again. 
  
"It's nothing, nothing," said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy's t hanks. "I did know your grandfather, after all...." 
  
"He always spoke very highly of you, sir," said Malfoy quickly. "Said you were the best potion-maker he'd ever known. ..." 
  
Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that intrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin. 
  
"I'd like a word with you, Draco," said Snape suddenly. 
  
"Now , Severus," said Slughorn, hiccuping again, "it's Christ mas, do n't be too hard " 
  
"I am his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or other-wise, to be," said Snape curtly. "Follow me, Draco." 
  
They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful. Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, "I'll be back in a bit, Luna  er  bathroom." 
  
"All right," she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely in terested. It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn's office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slyt herin common room. . . . Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices. 
  
" . . . cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled " 
  
"I didn't have anything to do with it, all right?" 
  
"I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy a nd foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it." 
  
"Who suspects me?" said Malfoy angrily. "For the last time, I didn't do it, okay? That Bell girl must ' ve had an enemy no on e knows about  don't look at me like that! I know what you're do-ing, I'm not stupid, but it won't work  I can stop you!" 
  
There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, "Ah . . . Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?" 
  
"I'm not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don't want you butting in !" Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . . What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this  Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking? 
  
"So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco " 
  
"So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!" jeered Malfoy. 
  
There was another pause. Then Snape said, "You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things ." 
  
"You'd better stop telling me to come to your office then!" 
  
"Listen to me," said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. "I am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow, Draco " 
  
"Looks like you'll have to break it, then, because I don't need your protection! It's my job, he gave it to me and I'm doing it, I've got a plan and it's going to work, it's just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!" 
  
"What is your plan ?" 
  
"It's none of your business !" 
  
" If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you ..." 
  
"I have all the assistance I need, thanks, I'm not alone!" 
  
"You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the ex-treme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes " 
  
"I would've had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn't put them in detention!" 
  
"Keep your voice down!" spat Snape, for Malfoy ' s voice had risen excitedly. "If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL this time around, they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres " 
  
"What does it matter?" said Malfoy. "Defense Against the Dark Arts  its all just a joke, isn't it, an act? Like any of us need pro-tecting against the Dark Arts " 
  
"It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!" said Snape. "Where do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle " 
  
"They're not the only ones, I've got other people on my side, better people!" 
  
"Then why not confide in me, and I can " 
  
"I know what you're up to! You want to steal my glory!" 
  
There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, "You are speaking like a child. I quite understand that your fathers capture and imprisonment has upset you, but " 
  
Harry had barely a second ' s warning; he heard Malfoy's footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open . Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Slughorns office, around the distant corner, and out of sight. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfath-omable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hid-den beneath the cloak, his mind racing. 

Chapter 16: A very frosty Christmas


So Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to help him?" 
"If you ask. that once more," said Harry, "I'm going to stick this sprout " 
"I'm only checking!" said Ron. They were standing alone at the Burrow's kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them. 
"Yes, Snape was offering to help him!" said Harry. "He said he'd promised Malfoy's mother to protect him, that he'd made an Un-breakable Oath or something " 
"An Unbreakable Vow?" said Ron, looking stunned. "Nah, he can't have. . . . Are you sure?" 
"Yes, I'm sure," said Harry. "Why, what does it mean?" 
Well, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow. . . ." 
"I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?" 
"You die," said Ron simply. "Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went mental," said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. "Only time I've ever seen Dad as angry as Mum, Fred reckons his left but-tock has never been the same since." 
"Yeah, well, passing over Fred's left buttock " 
"I beg your pardon?" said Fred's voice as the twins entered the kitchen. 
"Aaah, George, look at this. They're using knives and everything. Bless them." 
"I'll be seventeen in two and a bit months' time," said Ron grumpily, "and then I'll be able to do it by magic!" 
"But meanwhile," said George, sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, "we can enjoy watching you demon-strate the correct use of a  whoops-a-daisy!" 
"You made me do that!" said Ron angrily, sucking his cut thumb. "You wait, when I'm seventeen " 
"I'm sure you'll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills," yawned Fred. 
"And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald," said George, "what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called  unless our information is faulty  Lavender Brown?" 
Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. "Mind your own business." 
"What a snappy retort," said Fred. "I really don't know how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know was... how did it happen?" 
"What d'you mean?" 
"Did she have an accident or something?" 
"What?" ..|; 
"Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Care-ful, now!" 
Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand, 
"Ron!" she said furiously. "Don't you ever let me see you throw-ing knives again!" 
"I wont," said Ron, "let you see," he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain. 
"Fred, George, I'm sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two." ; 
"No problem," said George. 
- "Then, as Charlie isn't coming home, that just leaves Harry and ;|/ Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny " " that'll make Ginny's Christmas " muttered Fred. " everyone should be comfortable. Well, they'll have a bed, anyway," said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed. 
"Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?" asked Fred. Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. "No, he's busy, I expect, at the Ministry." 
"Or he's the world's biggest prat," said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. "One of the two. "Well, let's get going, then, George." 
"What are you two up to?" asked Ron. "Cant you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we'll be free 
too!" 
"No, I don't think we can do that," said Fred seriously. "It's very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs " " and if you want people to help you, Ron," added George, throwing the paper airplane at him, "I wouldn't chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We're off to the village, there's a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are some-thing marvelous . . , almost like real magic. ..." 
"Gits," said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. "Would've only taken them ten seconds and then we could've gone too." 
"I couldn't," said Harry. "I promised Dumbledore I wouldn't wander off while I'm staying here." 
"Oh yeah," said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, "Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?" 
"Yep," said Harry. "I'm going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledores top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too." 
"Pity you didn't hear what Malfoys actually doing, though." "I couldn't have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape." 
There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, " 'Course, you know what they'll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They'll say Snape isn't really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoy's up to." 
"They didn't hear him," said Harry flatly. "No one's that good an actor, not even Snape." 
"Yeah . . . I'm just saying, though/' said Ron. 
Harry turned to face him, frowning. "You think I'm right, though?" , 
"Yeah, I do!" said Ron hastily. "Seriously, I do! But they're all convinced Snape's in the Order, aren't they?" 
Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he's doing. . . . 
This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportu-nity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn's party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time. 
Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Mal-foy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying "I told you so," which he had done sev-eral times to Ron already. 
Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as hr pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to il.s back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet. 
They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasleys favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume con-trol, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a par-ticularly jazzy number called "A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love," Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestinas voice. 
Oh, come and stir my cauldron, 
And if you do it right, 
I'll boil you up some hot strong love 
To keep you warm tonight. 
"We danced to this when we were eighteen!" said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. "Do you remember, Arthur?" 
"Mphf?" said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. "Oh yes ... marvelous tune . . ." 
With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry, who was sitting next to him. 
"Sorry about this," he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. "Be over soon." 
"No problem," said Harry, grinning. "Has it been busy at the Ministry?" 
"Very," said Mr. Weasley. "I wouldn't mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we've made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater  only don't repeat that, Harry," he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden. 
"They're not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?" asked Harry. 
"I'm afraid so," said Mr. Weasley. "I know Dumbledore's tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. ... I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he's about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they're making some progress, and 'three arrests' sounds better than 'three mistaken arrests and releases'. . . but again, this is 
all top secret. . . ." 
"I won't say anything," said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called "You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me." 
"Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?" 
"I checked, Harry," said Mr. Weasley at once. "I went and searched the Malfoys' house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn't have been there." 
"Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you'd looked . . . but this is something different. . . . Well, something more ..." 
And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between 
Malfoy and Snape, As Harry spoke, he saw Lupin's head turn a lit-tle toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestina's crooning. 
Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone? It's left me for a spell... 
"Has it occurred to you, Harry," said Mr. Weasley, "that Snape was simply pretending  ?" 
"Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoy's up to?" said Harry quickly. "Yeah, I thought you'd say that. But how do we know?" 
"It isn't our business to know," said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. "It's Dumbledores business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us." 
"But," said Harry, "just say  just say Dumbledores wrong about Snape " 
"People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledores judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Severus." 
"But Dumbledore can make mistakes," argued Harry. "He says it himself. And you"  he looked Lupin straight in the eye  "do you honestly like Snape?" 
"I neither like nor dislike Severus," said Lupin. "No, Harry, I am speaking the truth," he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expres-sion. "We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that hap-pened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usu-ally do at the full moon." 
"But he 'accidentally' let it slip that you're a werewolf, so you had to leave!" said Harry angrily. 
Lupin shrugged. "The news would have leaked out anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful." 
"Maybe he didn't dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him!" said Harry. 
"You are determined to hate him, Harry," said Lupin with a faint smile. "And I understand; with James as your father, with Sir-ius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on Dumbledore's orders that Severus questioned Draco." ; 
. . . and now you've torn it quite apart I'll thank you to give back my heart! 
Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically. 
"Eez eet over?" said Fleur loudly. "Thank goodness, what an 'orrible " 
"Shall we have a nightcap, then?" asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet. "Who wants eggnog?" 
"What have you been up to lately?" Harry asked Lupin, as Mr, Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation. 
"Oh, I've been underground," said Lupin. "Almost literally. That's why I haven't been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway." -: 
"What do you mean?" ' 
"I've been living among my fellows, my equals," said Lupin. "Werewolves," he added, at Harrys look of incomprehension. "Nearly all of them are on Voldemort's side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . . . ready-made." 
He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, "I am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing  and sometimes killing  to eat." 
"How come they like Voldemort?" 
"They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life," said Lupin. "And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . ." 
"Who's Greyback?" 
"You haven't heard of him?" Lupin's hands closed convulsively in his lap. "Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to conta-minate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough were-wolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people's sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results." 
Lupin paused and then said, "It was Greyback who bit me." "What?" said Harry, astonished. "When  when you were a kid, you mean?" 
"Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, know-ing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback's insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people." "But you are normal!" said Harry fiercely. "You've just got a  a 
problem " 
Lupin burst out laughing. "Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my 'furry little problem in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved 
rabbit." 
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful, Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to ask-ing Lupin. 
"Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?" 
"The Half-Blood what?" 
"Prince," said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recogni-tion. 
"There are no Wizarding princes," said Lupin, now smiling. "Is this a title you re thinking of adopting? I should have thought be-ing 'the Chosen One' would be enough." 
"It's nothing to do with me!" said Harry indignantly. "The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I've got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus " 
"Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts," said Lupin reminiscently. "There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn't move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle." 
"My dad used it," said Harry. "I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape." 
He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway com-ment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupins smile was a little too understanding. 
"Yes," he said, "but he wasn't the only one. As I say, it was very popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. , . ." 
"But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school," Harry persisted. 
"Not necessarily," said Lupin. "Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else." 
He looked into Harry's face and then said quietly, "James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him 'Prince.'" 
Abandoning pretense, Harry said, "And it wasn't Sirius? Or you?" 
"Definitely not." 
"Oh." Harry stared into the fire. "I just thought  well, he's helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has." 
"How old is this book, Harry?" 
"I dunno, I've never checked." 
"Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts," said Lupin. 
Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing "A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love," which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley's expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron's attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry. 
Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been pub-lished. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his father's friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . . 
"She's got to be joking. . . ." 
Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what ap-peared to be a thick gold chain. 
"What's chat?" asked Harry. ' 
"Its from Lavender," said Ron, sounding revolted^ "She earn 
honestly think I'd wear ..." 
Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter, Dan 
gling from the chain in large gold letters were the words: 
  
My sweetheart 
  
"Nice," he said. "Classy. You should definitely wear it in front ol Fred and George." 
"If you tell them," said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, "I  I  Ill " 
"Stutter at me?" said Harry, grinning. "Come on, would I?" 
"How could she think I'd like something like that, though?" Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked. 
"Well, think back," said Harry. "Have you ever let it slip that you'd like to go out in public with the words 'My Sweetheart' round your neck?" 
"Well... we don't really talk much," said Ron. "It's mainly . . ." 
"Snogging," said Harry. 
"Well, yeah," said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, "Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?" 
"I dunno," said Harry. "They were at Slughorn's party together, but I don't think it went that well." 
Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking. 
Harrys presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label read-ing To Master, From Kreacher, 
Harry stared at it. "D'you reckon this is safe to open?" he asked. "Can't be anything dangerous, all our mail's still being searched at the Ministry," replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously. 
"I didn't think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?" asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously. 
"Hermione would," said Ron. "But let's wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty." 
A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots. "Nice," said Ron, roaring with laughter. "Very thoughtful." "I'd rather have them than that necklace," said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once. 
Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch's hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spec-tacular golden necklace. 
"Fred and George gave them to me! Aren't they beautiful?" .: "Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we're washing our own socks," said George, waving an airy hand. "Parsnips, Remus?" 
"Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair," said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot. 
"'Ow 'orrible," said Fleur, with an affected little shudder. 
"Yes, isn't it?" said Ron. "Gravy, Fleur?" 
. In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat. 
"You are as bad as zat Tonks," said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. "She is always knocking " 
"I invited dear Tonks to come along today," said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. "But she wouldn't come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?" 
"No, I haven't been in contact with anybody very much," said Lupin. "But Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn't she?" 
"Hmmm," said Mrs. Weasley. "Maybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually." 
She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses? 
"Tonks's Patronus has changed its form," he told him. "Snape said so anyway. I didn't know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?" 
Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, "Sometimes ... a great shock ... an emotional up-heaval ..." 
"It looked big, and it had four legs," said Harry, struck by a sud-den thought and lowering his voice. "Hey ... it couldn't be  ?" 
"Arthur!" said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. "Arthur  it's Percy!" 
"What?" 
Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone. 
"Arthur, he's  he's with the Minister!" 
And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percy's wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of , them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do : more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Percy. 
There was a moment's painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, "Merry Christmas, Mother." 
"Oh, Percy!" said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms. 
Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walk-ing stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene. 
"You must forgive this intrusion," he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. "Percy and I were in the vicinity  working, you know  and he couldn't re-sist dropping in and seeing you all." 
But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else's heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all observing him, stony-faced. 
"Please, come in, sit down, Minister!" fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. Have a little purkey, or some tooding. ... 1 '. mean " 
"No, no, my dear Molly," said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house. "I don't want to intrude, wouldn't be here at all if Percy hadn't wanted to see you all so badly. . . ." 
"Oh, Perce!" said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him. 
". , . We've only looked in for five minutes, so I'll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure you I don't want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . Ah, that young man's finished, why doesn't he take a stroll with me?" 
The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Every-body looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour's pretense that he did not know Harry's name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates. 
"Yeah, all right," said Harry into the silence. 
He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour's talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone. 
"It's fine," he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair. "Fine," he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak. 
"Wonderful!" said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass 
through the door ahead of him. "We'll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I'll be off. Carry on, everyone!" 
Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys' overgrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat. 
"Charming," said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. "Charming." 
Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him. 
"I've wanted to meet you for a very long time," said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. "Did you know that?" 
"No," said Harry truthfully. |!. 
"Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you," said Scrimgeour. "Natural, of course, natural, after what you've been through. . . . Especially what happened at : the Ministry ...": 
He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, : so he went on, "I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has  most under-standably, as I say  prevented this." 
Still, Harry said nothing, waiting. 
"The rumors that have flown around!" said Scrimgeour. "Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted ... all these whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being 'the Chosen One'. . ." 
They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrim-geour was here. 
I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?", 
Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, ami the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it. 
"Yeah, we've discussed it." 
"Have you, have you . . ." said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pre-tended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. "And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?" 
"Sorry, but that's between us," said Harry. He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour's tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, "Oh, of course, if it's a question of confidences, I wouldn't want you to divulge . . . no, no ... and in any case, does it really matter whether you are 'the Chosen One' or not?" 
Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before re-sponding. "I don't really know what you mean, Minister." 
"Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously," said Scrim-geour with a laugh. "But to the Wizarding community at large . . . it's all perception, isn't it? It's what people believe that's important." 
Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it. 
"People believe you are 'the Chosen One,' you see," said Scrim-geour. "They think you quite the hero  which, of course, you arc, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway," he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, "the point is, you are a symbol of hope lor many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named  well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I can't help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost." 
The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, "Funny little chaps, aren't they? But what say you, Harry?" 
"I don't exactly understand what you want," said Harry slowly. '"Stand alongside the Ministry' . . . What does that mean?" 
"Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you," said Scrim-geour. "If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impres-sion. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample : opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily. ..." 
Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she? 
"So basically," he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, "you'd like to give the impression that I'm working for the Ministry?" 
"It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry," said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cot-toned on so quickly. "'The Chosen One,' you know. . . It's all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are hap-pening. ..." 
"But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry," said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, "won't that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry's up to?" 
"Well," said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, "well, yes, that's partly why we'd like " 
"No, I don't think that'll work," said Harry pleasantly. "You see, I don't like some of the things the Ministry's doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance." 
Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hard-ened instantly. "I would not expect you to understand," he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been. "These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old " 
"Dumbledore's a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn't think Stan should be in Azkaban either," said Harry. "You're making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot." 
They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, "I see. You prefer  like your hero, Dumbledore  to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?" "I don't want to be used," said Harry. 
"Some would say it's your duty to be used by the Ministry!" "Yeah, and others might say its your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison," said Harry, his temper rising now. "You're doing what Barty Crouch 
did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we've got Fudge, pretending everything's lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we've got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you've got 'the Chosen One' work-ing for you!" ' i 
"So you're not 'the Chosen One'?" said Scrimgeour. ' 
"I thought you said it didn't matter either way?" said Harry, with a bitter laugh. "Not to you anyway." 
"I shouldn't have said that," said Scrimgeour quickly. "It was tactless " 
"No, it was honest," said Harry. "One of the only honest things you've said to me. You don't care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you're winning the war against Voldemort. I haven't forgotten, Minister...." 
He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies. 
"I don't remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn't so keen to be pals last year." 
They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush. 
"What is Dumbledore up to?" said Scrimgeour brusquely. "Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?" 
"No idea," said Harry. 
"And you wouldn't tell me if you knew," said Scrimgeour, "would you?" 
"No, 1 wouldn't," said Harry. 
"Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can't find out by other means." 
"You can try," said Harry indifferently. "But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I'd have thought you'd have learned from his mis-takes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he's not Minister anymore, but Dumbledores still headmaster. I'd leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you." 
There was a long pause. 
"Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you," said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses, "Dumbledores man through and through, aren't you, Potter?" 
"Yeah, I am," said Harry. "Glad we straightened that out." 
And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back toward the house. 

Chapter 17: A sluggish memory


Late in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, Harry, Ron, and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school. Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she had been crying on and off ever since Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George, and Ginny all claimed credit). 
"Don't cry, Mum," said Ginny, patting her on the back as Mrs. Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. "It's okay. ..." 
"Yeah, don't worry about us," said Ron, permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, "or about Percy. He's such a prat, it's not really a loss, is it?" 
Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in her arms. 
"Promise me you'll look after yourself.. .. Stay out of trouble. ..." 
"I always do, Mrs. Weasley," said Harry. "I like a quiet life, you know me." 
She gave a watery chuckle and stood back. "Be good, then, all of you. ..." 
Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted "Hogwarts!" He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleys' kitchen and Mrs. Weasley's tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look; then he was slowing down, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor McGonagall's office. She barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate. 
"Evening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet." 
"No, Professor." 
Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came spinning into view. When Ginny had arrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagall's office and off toward Gryffindor Tower. Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the distance, he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin. 
"Baubles," said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice.
"No," she said. 
What dyou mean, no ? 
"There is a new password," she said. "And please don't shout."
"But we've been away, how're we supposed to  ?"
"Harry! Ginny!" 
Hermione was hurrying toward them, very pink-faced and wearing a cloak, hat, and gloves. 
"I got back a couple of hours ago, I've just been down to visit Hagrid and Buck  I mean Witherwings," she said breathlessly. "Did you have a good Christmas?" 
"Yeah," said Ron at once, "pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim " ] "I've got something for you, Harry," said Hermione, neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him. "Oh, hang on  password. Abstinence." 
"Precisely," said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole. 
"What's up with her?" asked Harry. 
"Overindulged over Christmas, apparently," said Hermione, rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room. "She and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor. Anyway..." 
She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a scroll of parchment with Dumbledore's writing on it. 
"Great," said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night. "Ive got loads to tell him  and you. Let's sit down " 
But at that moment there was a loud squeal of "Won-Won!" and Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into Ron's arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said, "There's a cable over here... Coming. Ginny?" 
"No, thanks, I said I'd meet Dean," said Ginny, though Harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic. Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling, match, Harry led Hermione over to the spare table. 
"So how was your Christmas?" 
"Oh, fine," she shrugged. "Nothing special. How was it at Won-Won's?" 
"I'll tell you in a minute," said Harry. "Look, Hermione, can't you " 
"No, I can't," she said flatly. "So don't even ask." 
"I thought maybe, you know, over Christmas "
"It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five-hundred-year-old wine, Harry, not me. So what was this important news you wanted to tell me?" 
She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so Harry dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all that he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape. When he had finished, Hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said, "Don't you think  ?" 
" he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he's doing?" 
"Well, yes," said Hermione. 
"Rons dad and Lupin think so," Harry said grudgingly. "But this definitely proves Malfoys planning something, you can't deny that." 
"No, I can't," she answered slowly. 
"And he's acting on Voldemort's orders, just like I said!" 
"Hmm .. . did either of them actually mention Voldemort's name?" 
Harry frowned, trying to remember. "I'm not sure ... Snape definitely said 'your master,' and who else would that be?" 
"I don't know," said Hermione, biting her lip. "Maybe his father?" 
She stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even noticing Lavender tickling Ron. "How's Lupin?" 
"Not great," said Harry, and he told her all about Lupins mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing. "Have you heard of this Fenrir Greyback?" 
"Yes, I have!" said Hermione, sounding startled. "And so have you, Harry!" 
"When, History of Magic? You know full well I never listened ..." 
"No, no, not History of Magic  Malfoy threatened Borgin with Kim!" said Hermione. "Back in Knockturn Alley, don't you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he'd be checking up on Borgin's progress!" 
Harry gaped at her. "I forgot! But this proves Malfoy s a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do?" 
"It is pretty suspicious," breathed Hermione. "Unless . . ." "Oh, come on," said Harry in exasperation, "you can't get round this one!" 
"Well . . . there is the possibility it was an empty threat." "You're unbelievable, you are," said Harry, shaking his head. 
"We'll see who's right. . . . You'll be eating your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, 1 had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well. . . ." 
And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year, they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now. 
The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years: a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight.

If you are seventeen years of age, or will turn seventeen on or before the 31st August next, you are eligible for a twelve-week course of Apparition Lessons from a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor. Please sign below if you would like to participate. Cost: 12 Galleons.
  
Harry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom. Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and trilled, "Guess who, Won-Won?" Harry turned to see Hermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione sped up to walk with Neville. 
"So  Apparition," said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain that Harry was not to mention what had just happened. "Should be a laugh, eh?" 
"I dunno," said Harry. "Maybe it's better when you do it yourself, I didnt enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for the ride." 
"I forgot you'd already done it. ... I'd better pass my test first 
time," said Ron, looking anxious. "Fred and George did," "Charlie failed, though, didn't he?" "Yeah, but Charlie's bigger than me"  Ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla  "so Fred and George 
didn't go on about it much . . . not to his face anyway . . ." "When can we take the actual test?" "Soon as we're seventeen. That's only March for me!" "Yeah, but you wouldn't be able to Apparate in here, not in the castle . . ." 
"Not the point, is it? Everyone would know I could Apparate if I wanted." 
Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Apparition. All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming , lessons; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will. 
"How cool will it be when we can just " Seamus clicked his ringers to indicate disappearance. "Me cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me, you wait till I can do it back. . . He'll never have another peaceful moment. . . ." 
Lost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of today's Charms lesson, he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face. 
"Harrys already Apparated," Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus lines: "I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick." "Dum  er  someone took him. Side-Along-Apparition, you know." 
"Whoa!" whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like. For the rest of the day, Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when he told them how uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson with Dumbledore. 
The lamps in Dumbledores office were lit, the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames, and the Pen-sieve was ready upon the desk once more. Dumbledores hands lay on either side of it, the right one as blackened and burnt-looking as ever. It did not seem to have healed at all and Harry wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did not ask; Dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there was, in any case, another subject he wanted to discuss. But before Harry could say anything about Snape and Malfoy, Dumbledore spoke. 
"I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas?" "Yes," said Harry. "He's not very happy with me." 
"No," sighed Dumbledore. "He is not very happy with me either. We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on." 
Harry grinned. 
"He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministry's doing a wonderful job.' 
Dumbledore smiled. 
"It was Fudge's idea originally, you know. During his last days in office, when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your 
support " 
"After everything Fudge did last year?" said Harry angrily. "After Umbridge ? 
"I told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the idea did not die when he left: office. Within hours of Scrimgeour's appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you " 
"So that's why you argued!" Harry blurted out. "It was in the Daily Prophet"' 
"The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally," said Dumbledore, "if only accidentally. Yes, that was why we argued. Well, it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last." 
"He accused me of being 'Dumbledore's man through and through.'" 
"How very rude of him." 
"I told him I was." 
Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harrys intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized 
that Dumbledore's bright blue eyes looked rather watery, ami stared hastily at his own knees. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady. 
"I am very touched, Harry." 
"Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you're not at Hogwarts," said Harry, still looking fixedly at his knees. 
"Yes, he is very nosy about that," said Dumbledore, now sounding cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to look up again. "He has even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It wasn't kind. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret." 
"So they still don't know where you go?" asked Harry, hoping for more information on this intriguing subject, but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his half-moon spectacles. 
"No, they don't, and the time is not quite right for you to know either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless there's anything else  ?" "There is, actually, sir," said Harry. "It's about Malfoy and Snape." 
"Professor Snape, Harry." 
"Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorns party . . . well, I followed them, actually. ..." 
Dumbledore listened to Harry's story with an impassive face. When Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments, then said, "Thank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great importance." 
"Not of great importance?" repeated Harry incredulously. "Professor, did you understand  ?" 
"Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me," said Dumbledore, a little sharply. "I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have con-lided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet." 
Harry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. What was going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing, in which case he had already heard everything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or was he really worried by what he had heard, but pretending not to be? 
"So, sir," said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice, "you definitely still trust  ?" 
"I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already," said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very tolerant anymore. "My answer has not changed." 
"I should think not," said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep. Dumbledore ignored him. 
"And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this evening." 
Harry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy? As though he had read Harry's mind, Dumbledore shook his head. 
"Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!" 
"I don't think what you've got to say is unimportant, sir," said Harry stiffly.
"Well, you are quite right, because it is not," said Dumbledore briskly. "I have two more memories to show you this evening, both obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, 1 think, the most important I have collected." 
Harry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received, but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further. 
"So," said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, "we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school. 
"Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the other first years to be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head," continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving. "How soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could talk to snakes, I do not know  perhaps that very evening. The knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-importance. 
"However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it reached the staff. He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed police, quiet, and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him." 
"Didn't you tell them, sir, what he'd been like when you met him at the orphanage?" asked Harry. 
"No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance." 
Dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, who had opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was Dumbledore's tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it! But then Harry remembered something. . . . 
"But you didn't really trust him, sir, did you? He told me . . . the Riddle who came out of that diary said, 'Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did.'" 
"Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy," said Dumbledore. "I had, as I have already indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first. He was very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much. He was careful never to reveal as much again, but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement, nor what Mrs. Cole had confided in me. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues. 
"As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want of a better term, although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts. 
"Rigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected in open wrongdoing, although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in the death of a girl. As you know, Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime. 
"I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts," said Dumbledore, placing his withered hand on the Pensieve. "Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him; they are too terrified. What I know, I found out after he had left Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort, after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking, after searching old records and questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike. 
"Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed with his parentage. This is understandable, of course; he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wizarding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Volde-mort, and began his investigations into his previously despised mother's family  the woman whom, you will remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death. 
"All he had to go upon was the single name 'Marvolo,' which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother's father's name. Finally, after painstaking research, through old books of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherin's surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand ..." : 
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a. small crystal bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory. 
"I was very lucky to collect this," he said, as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve. "As you will understand when we have experienced it. Shall we?" 
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness. 
It took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time Dumbledore had landed beside him. The Gaunts' house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots. The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But 
then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left. 
The door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry recognized at once: tall, pale, dark-haired, and handsome  the teenage Voldemort. 
Voldemort's eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair. For a few seconds they looked at each other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor. 
"YOU!" he bellowed. "YOU!" 
And he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife held aloft. 
"Stop." 
Riddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into the table, sending moldy pots crashing to the floor. He stared at Riddle. There was a long silence while they contemplated each other. The man broke it. 
"You speak it?" 
"Yes, I speak it," said Riddle. He moved forward into the room, allowing the door to swing shut behind him. Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort's complete lack of fear. His race merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment. 
"Where is Marvolo?" he asked. 
"Dead," said the other. "Died years ago, didn't he?" 
Riddle frowned. 
"Who are you, then?"
"Im Morfin, ain't I?"
"Marvolo's son?" 
"'Course I am, then..." ? ,, . 
Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see Riddle, and Harry saw that he wore Marvolo's black-stoned ring on his right hand. 
"I thought you was that Muggle," whispered Morfin. "You look mighty like that Muggle." 
"What Muggle?" said Riddle sharply. 
"That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that Muggle what lives in the big house over the way," said Morfin, and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them. "You look right like him. Riddle. But he's older now, in 'e? He's older'n you, now I think on it. ..." 
Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still clutching the edge of the table for support. "He come back, see," he added stupidly. 
Voldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possibilities. Now he moved a little closer and said, "Riddle came back?" 
"Ar, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth!" said Morfin, spitting on the floor again. "Robbed us, mind, before she ran off. , Where's the locket, eh, where's Slytherin's locket?" 
Voldemort did not answer. Morfin was working himself into a rage again; he brandished his knife and shouted, "Dishonored us, , she did, that little slut! And whore you, coming here and asking questions about all that? It's over, innit. . . . It's over. ..." 
He looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort moved forward. As he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing Voldemort's lamp and Morfin's candle, extinguishing everything. . . . Dumbledore's fingers closed tightly around Harry's arm and they were soaring back into the present again. The soft golden light in Dumbledore's office seemed to dazzle Harry's eyes after that impenetrable darkness. | 
"Is that all?" said Harry at once. "Why did it go dark, what happened?" 
"Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward," said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry back into his seat. "When he awoke next morning, he was lying on the floor, quite alone. Marvolo's ring had gone. 
"Meanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was running along the High Street, screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house: Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and father. 
"The Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avadu Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage. . . . The exception sits before me," Dumbledore added, with a nod to Harry's scar. "The Ministry, on the other hand, knew at once that this was a wizard's murder. They also knew that a convicted Muggle-hater lived across the valley from the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people. 
"So the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not need to question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency. He admitted to the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could know. He was proud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been awaiting his chance all these years. He handed over his wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles. And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight. 
All that disturbed him was the fact that his fathers ring had disappeared. 'He'll kill me for losing it,' he told his captors over and over again. 'He'll kill me for losing his ring.' And that, apparently, was all he ever said again. He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo's last heirloom, and is buried beside the prison, alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls." 
"So Voldemort stole Morfin's wand and used it?" said Harry, sitting up straight. 
"That's right," said Dumbledore. "We have no memories to show us this, but I think we can be fairly sure what happened. Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded across the valley to 'the big house over the way.' There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, and, for good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle's mind, laid Morfin's wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed." 
"And Morfin never realized he hadn't done it?" 
"Never," said Dumbledore. "He gave, as I say, a full and boastful confession." 
"But he had this real memory in him all the time!" "Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him," said Dumbledore, "and why should anybody delve further into Morfin's mind when he had already confessed to the crime? However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemort's past. I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure Morfin's release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision, however, Morfin had died." 
"But how come the Ministry didn't realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?" Harry asked angrily "He was underage at the time, wasn't he? I thought they could detect underage magic!" "You are quite right  they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by " 
"Dobby," growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. "So if you're underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard's house, the Ministry won't know?" 
"They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic," said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harrys face. "They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring's obedience while within their walls." 
"Well, that's rubbish," snapped Harry. "Look what happened here, look what happened to Morfin!" 
"I agree," said Dumbledore. "Whatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders he had not committed. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory before we part. ..." 
Dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Harry fell silent at once, remembering that Dumbledore had said it was the most important one he had collected. Harry noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad? 
"This will not take long," said Dumbledore, when he had finally emptied the phial. "We shall be back before you know it. Once more into the Pensieve, then . . ." 
And Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at once. 
It was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny, straw-colored hair quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had had his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleon-sized bald patch on his crown. His mustache, less massive than it was these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of wine, the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple. 
Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in Slughorn's office. Haifa dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his, and all in their mid-teens. Harry recognized Voldemort at once. His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolo's gold-and-black ring; he had already killed his father. 
"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?" he asked. 
"Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn't tell you," said Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered finger at Riddle, though ruining the effect slightly by winking. "I must say, I'd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.
Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. 
"What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldnt, and your careful flattery of the people who matter  thank you fm the pineapple, by the way, you're quite right, it is my favorite  " 
As several of the boys tittered, something very odd happened. The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog, so that Harry could see nothing but the face of Dumbledore, who was standing beside him. Then Slughorn's voice rang out through the mist, unnaturally loudly, "You'll go wrong, boy, mark my words. " 
The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it, nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a small golden clock standing upon Slughorn's desk chimed eleven o'clock. 
"Good gracious, is it that time already?" said Slughorn. "You'd better get going, boys, or we'll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it's detention. Same goes for you, Avery." 
Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out. Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn. 
"Look sharp, Tom," said Slughorn, turning around and finding him still present. "You don't want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect..." 
"Sir, I wanted to ask you something." 
"Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away...."
"Sir, I wondered what you know about. . . about Horcruxes?" 
And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughorn's voice boomed out again, just as it had done before. 
"I don't know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn't tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and dont let me catch you mentioning them again!" 
"Well, that's that," said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry. 
"Time to go." 
And Harry's feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the 
rug in front of Dumbledore's desk. 
"That's all there is?" said Harry blankly. 
Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all, but he could not see what was so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer. 
"As you might have noticed," said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk, "that memory has been tampered with." 
"Tampered with?" repeated Harry, sitting back down too. 
"Certainly," said Dumbledore. "Professor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections." 
"But why would he do that?" 
"Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers," said Dumbledore. "He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is all to the good, for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations. 
"And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry. It will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all." 
Harry stared at him. 
"But surely, sir," he said, keeping his voice as respectful as possible, "you don't need me  you could use Legilimency ... or Veritaserum. ..." 
"Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both," said Dumbledore. "He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection. 
"No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory, Harry. . . . How important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good luck . . . and good night." 
A little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet quickly. "Good night, sir." 
As he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard Phineas Nigellus say, "I can't see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore." 
"I wouldn't expect you to, Phineas," replied Dumbledore, and Fawkes gave another low, musical cry. 

Chapter 18: Birthday Surprises
The next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him, though separately, for Hermione still refused to remain in Ron's presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look.
Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all.
'He loves you,' he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried egg. 'Won't refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.'
Hermione, however, took a gloomier view.
'He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn't get it out of him,' she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break. 'Horcruxes ... Horcruxes ... I've never even heard of them ...'
'You haven't?'
Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were.
'They must be really advanced Dark magic, or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I think it's going to be difficult to get the information, Harry, you'll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strategy ..."
'Ron reckons 1 should just hang back after Potions this afternoon ...'
'Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it,' she said, flaring up at once. 'After all, when has Won-Won's judgement ever been faulty?'
'Hermione, can't you '
'No!' she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankle-deep in snow.
Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and ignored both Harry and Ron.
'What've you done?' Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermione's haughty profile.
But before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room.
'Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott's Third Law ... who can tell me -? But Miss Granger can, of course!'
Hermione recited at top speed: 'Golpalott's-Third-Law- states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to- more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separale- components.'
'Precisely!' beamed Slughorn. Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott's Third Law as true ..."
Harry was going to have to take Slughorn's word for it that Golpalott's Third Law was true, because he had not under-stood any of it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next, either.
'... which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion's ingredients by Scarpin's Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in a 


of themselves, but to find that added component which will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements -'
Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half-open, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on.
'... and so,' finished Slughorn, 'I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don't forget your protective gloves!'
Hermione had left her stool and was halfway towards Siughorn's desk before the rest of the class had realised it was time to move, and by the time Harry, Ron and Ernie returned to the table, she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it.
'it's a shame that the Prince won't be able to help you much with this, Harry,' she said brightly as she straightened up. 'You have to understand the principles involved this time. No short cuts or cheats!'
Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Siughorn's desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done.
'You sure the Prince hasn't got any tips?' Ron muttered to Harry.
Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and turned to the chapter on Antidotes. There was Golpalott's Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Prince's hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it.
'Nothing,' said Harry gloomily.
Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at non-verbal incan-tations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, 'Specialis revelio!' over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him.
It took Harry only five minutes to realise that his reputa-tion as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had with-drawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione's expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being out-performed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. More to avoid watching this irritating sight than any-thing else, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince's book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force.
And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes.
Just shove a bezoar down their throats.
Harry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn't he once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn't Snape mentioned them in their first ever Potions lesson? 'A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons.'
It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened towards the store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small card box on which had been scribbled the word 'Bezoars'.
He opened the box just as Slughorn called, Two minutes left, everyone!' Inside were half a dozen shrivelled brown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron.
'Time's ... UP!' called Slughorn genially. 'Well, let's see how you've done! Blaise ... what have you got for me?'
Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up com-pletely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand.
Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie's potion and passed on to Ron's with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron's cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly.
'And you, Harry,' he said. 'What have you got to show me?'
Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm.
Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter.
'You've got a nerve, boy!' he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. 'Oh, you're like your mother ... well, 1 can't fault you ... a bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions!'
Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients including a chunk of her own hair,
bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry.
'And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?' she asked through gritted teeth.
That's the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!' said Slughorn happily, before Harry could reply. 'Just like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it's undoubtedly from Lily he gets it ... yes, Harry, yes, if you've got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick ... although as they don't work on everything, and are pretty rare, it's still worth knowing how to mix antidotes ...'
The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled some-thing that looked like cat sick over himself. Before either of them could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang.
Time to pack up!' said Slughorn. 'And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!'
Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon.
Harry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the room.
'Come on, now, Harry, you'll be late for your next lesson,' said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragonskin briefcase.
'Sir,' said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, '1 wanted to ask you something.'
'Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away ..."
'Sir, 1 wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes?'
Slughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, 'What did you say?' 'I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see -'
'Dumbledore put you up to this,' whispered Slughorn.
His voice had changed completely. It was not genial any more, but shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow.
'Dumbledore's shown you that - that memory,' said Slughorn. 'Well? Hasn't he?'
'Yes,' said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie.
'Yes, of course,' said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face. 'Of course ... well, if you've seen that memory, Harry, you'll know that I don't know anything - anything -he repeated the word forcefully '- about Horcruxes.'
He seized his dragonskin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door.
'Sir,' said Harry desperately, 'I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory -'
'Did you?' said Slughorn. Then you were wrong, weren't you? WRONG!'
He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word, slammed the dungeon door behind him.
Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was resentful that Harry hadn't slipped him a bezoar, too.
'It would've just looked stupid if we'd both done it!' said Harry irritably. 'Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn't I? Oh, will you gel a grip!' he added in exasperation, as Ron winced at the sound of the name.
Infuriated by his failure and by Ron and Hermione's atti-
tudes, Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack.
When Harry did noi question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch prac- tice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him.
Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first lime in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar,
'I haven't found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!" she told him. 'Not a single one! I've been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions -nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduciion to Magick Mostc Evilc  listen  "of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction" ... 1 mean, why mention it, then?' she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. 'Oh, shut up,' she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag. 'I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see -

The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-grey clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth-years' first Apparition lesson, which was sched-uled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds. 
When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Lavender) they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick and Sprout - the Heads of House - and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition Instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether constant dis-appearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish. 
'Good morning,' said the Ministry wizard, when all the stu-dents had arrived and the Heads of House had called for quiet. 'My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry-Apparition Instructor for the next twelve weeks. 1 hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition test in this time -' 
'Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!' barked Professor McGonagall. 
Everybody looked round. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argu-ment. Harry glanced quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less because of Malfoy's rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his house. 
'- by which time, many of you may be ready to take your test,' Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption. 
'As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The Headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practise. May I emphasise that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try. 
'I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.' 
There was a great scrambiing and jostling as people separ-ated, banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The Heads of House moved among the students, marshalling them into position and breaking up arguments. 
'Harry, where are you going? 1 demanded Hermione. 
But Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivvying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and looking mutinous. 
'I don't know how much longer, all right?' Malfoy shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind him. 'It's taking longer than I thought it would.' 
Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess what he was going to say. 
'Look, it's none of your business what I'm doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you're told and keep a lookout!' 
'! tell my friends what I'm up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me," Harry said, just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him. 
Malfoy spun round on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, but at thai precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, 'Quiet!' and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the front. 
Thank you,' said Twycross. :Now then ...' 
He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in from of every student. 
The important things to remember when Apparating are the three Ds!' said Twycross. 'Destination, Determination, Deliberation! 
'Step one: fix your mind firmly upon the desired destin-ation,' said Twycross. 'In this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.' 
Everybody looked around furtively, to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn't stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts. 
"Step two,' said Twycross, 'focus your determination to occupy the visualised space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!' 
Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop. 
'Step three,' called Twycross, 'and only when 1 give the com-mand ... lum on the spot, feeiing your way into nothingness, moving with deliberation 1. On my command, now ... one- 1 
Harry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly. 
Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three Ds stood for. 
: - THREE!' 
Harry spun on the spot, lost his balance and nearly fell over. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouet-ting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him. 
'Never mind, never mind,' said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better. 'Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your original positions ...' 
The second atlem.pt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started. 
The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified. 
'Sph'nching, or the separation of random body parts,' said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, 'occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continually upon your destination, and move, without hasie, but with deliberation ... thus.'
Twycross stepped forwards, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. 'Remember the three Ds,' he said, 'and try again ... one -two - three -' 
But an hour later, Susan's Splinching was still ihe most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, 'Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: Destin-ation. Determination. Deliberation.' 
With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving towards the Entrance Hall. 
'How did you do?' asked Ron, hurrying towards Harry. '1 think 1 felt something the last time I tried - a kind of tingling in my feet.' 
'1 expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,' said a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking. 
'1 didn't feel anything,' said Harry, ignoring this inter-ruption. "But 1 don't care about that now-' 
'What d'you mean, you don't care ... don't you want to leam to Apparate?' said Ron incredulously. 
'I'm not fussed, really. I prefer flying,' said Harry, glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and speeding up as they came into the Entrance Hall. 'Look, hurry up, will you, there's something I want to do ...' 
Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to Gryffindor Tower at a run. They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted short cuts. Within five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole. 
'Are you going to tell me what we're doing, then?' asked Ron, panting slightly. 
'Up here,' said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys' staircase. 
Their dormitory was, as Ham' had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently. 
'Harry ...' 
'Malfoy's using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was argu-ing with Crabbe just now. 1 want to know ... aha.' 
He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped with [he tip of his wand. 
'I solemn!)' swear that I am up to no good ... or Malfoy is, 
At once, the Marauder's Map appeared on the parchment's surface. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle's floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labelled black dots that signified each of the castle's occupants. 
'Help me find Malfoy,' said Harry urgently. 
He laid the map upon his bed and he and Ron leaned over it, searching. 
'There!' said Ron, after a minute or so. 'He's in the Slytherin common room, look ... with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle ..." 
Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once. 
'Well, I'm keeping an eye on him from now on,' he said firmly. 'And the moment 1 see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it'll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he's-' 
He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rum-maging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants. 
Despite his determination 10 catch Malfoy out, Harry had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks. Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admit-tedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high leve! of security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose ihat he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle appeared to be going their dif-ferent ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older - Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living proof. 
February moved towards March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation, a sign went up on all common-room noticeboards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been cancelled. Ron was furious. 
'It was on my birthday!' he said, 'i was looking forward to that!' 
'Not a big surprise, though, is it?' said Harry. 'Not after what happened to Katie.' 
She had still not returned from Si Mungo's. What was more, further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of students at Hogwarts. 
'But now all I've got to look forward to is stupid Appar-ition!' said Ron grumpily. 'Big birthday treat ...' 
Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as 
ever, though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves. Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of ill-feeling towards Wilkie Twycross and his three Ds, which had inspired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dog-breath and Dung-head. 
'Happy birthday, Ron,' said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. 'Have a present.' 
He threw the package across on to Ron's bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night. 
'Cheers,' said Ron drowsily, and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed, opened his own crunk and began rum-maging in it for the Marauder's Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis. 
'Right,' he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tap-ping it quietly and murmuring, 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,' so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear. 
'Nice one, Harry!' said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper's gloves Harry had given him. 
'No problem,' said Harry absent-mindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. 'Hey ... I don't think he's in his bed ...' 
Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure. 
'Seriously good haul this year!' he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. 'See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I'll come of age next year too ... 
'Cool,' muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast ... he was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study ... he wasn't in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing ... 
'Want one? 1 said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons. 
'No thanks,' said Harry, looking up. 'Malfoy's gone again!' 
'Can't have done,' said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. 'Come on. if you don't hurry up you'll have to Apparate on an empty-stomach ... might make it easier, 1 suppose ..." 
Ron looked thoughtfully ai the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third. 
Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, 'Mischief managed,' though it hadn't been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Malfoy's periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, bur even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea; he had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day wilhout his absence being remarked upon, 
'Ready?' he said to Ron. 
He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realised that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely un-focused look on his face. 
'Ron? Breakfast.' 
'I'm not hungry,' 
Harry stared ai him. 
'I thought you just said -?' 
-Well, all right, I'll come down with you,' sighed Ron, 'but I don't want to eat.' 
Harry scrutinised him suspiciously. 
'You've just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven't you?' 
'It's not that,' Ron sighed again. 'You ... you wouldn't understand.' 
'Fair enough,' said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door. 
'Harry!' said Ron suddenly. 
'What?' 
'Harry, I can't stand it!' 
'You can't stand what?' asked Harry, now starling to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick. 
'I can't stop thinking about her!' said Ron hoarsely. 
Harry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav', he would have to pui his foot down. 
'Why does that stop you having breakfast?' Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings. 
'I don't think she knows I exist,' said Ron with a desperate gesture. 
'She definitely knows you exist,' said Harry, bewildered. 'She keeps snogging you, doesn't she?' 
Ron blinked. 
'Who are you talking about?' 
Who are you talking about?' said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation. 
'Romilda Vane,' said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight. They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, 'This is a joke, right? You're joking.' 
T think ... Harry, 1 ihink I love her,' said Ron in a strangled voice. 
'OK,' said Harry, walking up to Ron 10 get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, 'OK ... say that again with a straight face.' 
'I love her,' repeated Ron breathlessly. 'Have you seen her hair, it's all black and shiny and silky ... and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her -' 
'This is really funny and everything,' said Harry impatiently, 'but joke's over, all right? Drop it.' 
He turned to leave; he had got two steps towards the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked round. Ron's fist was drawn right back, his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again. 
Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Le\icorpus!
Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more; he dangled helplessly, upside-down, his robes hanging off him. 
'What was that for?' Harry bellowed. 
'You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!' shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head. 
'This is insane!' said Harry. 'What's got into -?' 
And then he saw the box lying open on Ron's bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll. 
'Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?' 
'They were a birthday present!' shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. '1 offered you one, didn't 1?' 
'You just picked them up off the floor, didn't you?' 
'They'd fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!' 
'They didn't fall off your bed, you prat, don't you under-stand? They were mine, 1 chucked them out of my trunk when 1 was looking for the map. They're the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas and they're all spiked with love potion!' 
But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron. 
'Romilda?' he repeated. 'Did you say Romilda? Harry - do you know her? Can you introduce me?' 
Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him - the part closest to his throbbing right ear - was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off ... but on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry- thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane. 
'Yeah, I'll introduce you,' said Harry, thinking fast. 'I'm going to let you down now, OK?' 
He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning. 
'She'll be in Slughorn's office, 1 said Harry confidently, leading the way to the door. 
'Why will she be in there?' asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to keep up. 
'Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,' said Harry, inventing wildly. 
'Maybe 1 could ask if 1 can have them with her?' said Ron eagerly. 
'Great idea,' said Harry. Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Harry had not foreseen. 
'You're lace, Won-Won!' she pouted. 'I've got you a birth-day-' 
'Leave me alone,' said Ron impatiently, 'Harry's going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.' 
And without another word to her, he pushed his way oui of the portrait hole. Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them. 
Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but he answered his office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing-gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed. 
'Harry,' he mumbled. 'This is very early for a call ... I generally sleep late on a Saturday ..." 
'Professor, I'm really sorry to disturb you,' said Harry as quietly as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past Slughorn into his room, 'but my friend Ron's swallowed a love potion by mistake. You couldn't make him an antidote, could you? I'd take him to Madam Pomfrey, but we're not supposed to have anything from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and, you know ... awkward questions ...' 
Td have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy, Harry, an expert potioneer like you?' asked Slughorn. 'Er,' said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room, 'well, I've never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it right Ron might've done something serious -' 
Helpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, 'I can't see her. Harry - is he hiding her?' 
'Was this potion within date?' asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron with professional interest. 'They can strengthen, you know, the longer they're kept.' 
That would explain a lot,' panted Harry, now positively wrestling with Ron to keep him from knocking Slughorn over. 'It's his birthday, Professor,' he added imploringly. 
'Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,' said Slughorn, relenting. 'I've got the necessary here in my bag, it's not a difficult antidote ...' 
Ron burst through the door into Slughorn's overheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasselled footstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry around the neck and muttered, 'She didn't see that, did she?' 
'She's not here yet,' said Harry, watching Slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle. 
That's good,' said Ron fervently. 'How do I look?' 
'Very handsome,' said Slughorn smoothly, handing Ron a glass of clear liquid. 'Now drink that up, it's a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know,' 
'Brilliant,' said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down noisily. 
Harry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and van-ished, to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror. 
'Back to normal, then?' said Harry, grinning. Slughorn chuckled. Thanks a lot, Professor.' 
'Don't mention it, m'boy, don't mention it,' said Slughorn, as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. 'Pick-me-up, that's what he needs,' Slughorn continued, now-bustling over to a table loaded with drinks. 'I've got Butter-beer, I've got wine, I've got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead ... hmm ... meant to give that to Dumbledore for 
Christmas ... ah well ...' he shrugged '... he can't miss what he's never had! Why don't we open it now and celebrate Mr Weasley's birthday? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love ...' 
He chortled again and Harry joined in. This was the firsi time he had found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps, if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood ... perhaps if they got through enough of the oak-matured mead ... 
There you are, then,' said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a glass of mead each, before raising his own. 'Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph -' 
'- Ron -' whispered Harry. 
But Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it. 
There was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn, it seemed, did not. 
'- and may you have many more - 
'Ron!'
Ron had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets. 
'Professor!' Harry bellowed. 'Do something]' 
But Slughorn seemed paralysed by shock. Ron twitched and choked: his skin was turning blue. 
'What - but -' spluttered Slughorn. 
Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted towards Slughorn's open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of Ron's gargling breath filled the room. Then 
he found it - the shrivelled kidney-like stone Slughorn had taken from him in Potions. 
He hurtled back to Ron's side, wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still.

Chapter 19: Elf Tails
So, all in all, not one of Ron's better birthdays?" said Fred.
It was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows curtained, the lamps lit. Ron's was the only occupied bed. Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were sitting around him; they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors, trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out. Madam Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight o'clock. Fred and George had arrived at ten past.
"This isn't how we imagined handing over our present," said George grimly, putting down a large wrapped gift on Ron's bedside cabinet and sitting beside Ginny.
"Yeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious," said Fred.
"There we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise him " said George.
"You were in Hogsmeade?" asked Ginny, looking up.
"We were thinking of buying Zonko's," said Fred gloomily. "A Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a fat lot of good it'll do us if you lot aren't allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymon ... But never mind that now."
He drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ron's pale face.
"How exactly did it happen, Harry?"
Harry retold the story he had already recounted, it felt like a hundred times to Dumbledore, to McGonagall, to Madam Pomfrey, to Hermione, and to Ginny.
". . . and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up, and they brought Ron up here. They reckon he'll be all right. Madam Pomfrey says he'll have to stay here a week or so ... keep taking essence of rue . . ."
"Blimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar," said George in a low voice.
"Lucky there was one in the room," said Harry, who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone.
Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had been exceptionally quiet all day. Having hurtled, white-faced, up to Harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened., she had taken almost no part in Harry and Ginny's obsessive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned, but merely stood beside them, clench-jawed and frightened-looking, until ai last they had been allowed in to see him.
"Do Mum and Dad know?" Fred asked Ginny. "They've already seen him, they arrived an hour ago  they're in Dumbledore's office now, but they'll be back soon. . . ."
There was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in his sleep.
"So the poison was in the drink?" said Fred quietly. 
"Yes," said Harry at once; he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again. "Slughorn poured it out "
"Would he have been able to slip something into Ron's glass without you seeing?"
"Probably," said Harry, "but why would Slughorn want to poison Ron?"
"No idea," said Fred, frowning. "You don't think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake? Meaning to get you?"
"Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry?" asked Ginny. "I dunno," said Fred, "but there must be loads of people who'd like to poison Harry, mustn't there? 'The Chosen One' and all that?" "So you think Slughorn's a Death Eater?" said Ginny. :,
"Anything's possible," said Fred darkly. "He could be under the Imperius Curse," said George. "Or he could be innocent," said Ginny. "The poison could have been in the bottle, in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself."
"Who'd want to kill Slughorn?"
"Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side," said Harry. "Slughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts. And . . ." He thought of the memory Dumbledore had not yet been able to extract from Slughorn. "And maybe Voldemort wants him out of the way, maybe he thinks he could be valuable to Dumbledore."
"But you said Slughorn had been planning to give th.u Untie to Dumbledore for Christmas," Ginny reminded him. "So the poisoner could just as easily have been after Dumbledore."
"Then the poisoner didn't know Slughorn very well," said Hermione, speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold. "Anyone who knew Slughorn would have I known there was a good chance he'd keep something that tasty for himself." I
"Er-my-nee," croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them
They all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring.
The dormitory doors flew open, making them all jump: Hagrid came striding toward them, his hair rain-flecked, his bearskin coat flapping behind him, a crossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of muddy dolphin-sized footprints all over the floor.
"Bin in the forest all day!" he panted. "Aragog's worse, I bin readin' to him  didn' get up ter dinner till jus' now an' then Professor Sprout told me abou' Ron! How is he?"
"Not bad," said Harry. "They say he'll be okay."
"No more than six visitors at a time!" said Madam Pomfrey, hurrying out of her office.
"Hagrid makes six," George pointed out.
"Oh . . . yes. .." said Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have been counting Hagrid as several people due to his vastness. To cover her confusion, she hurried off to clear up his muddy foot prints with her wand.
"I don' believe this," said Hagrid hoarsely, shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at Ron. "Jus' don' believe it... Look at him lyin' there. . . . Who'd want ter hurt him, eh?"
"That's just what we were discussing," said Harry. "We don't know." 
"Someone couldn have a grudge against the Gryfinndor Quidditch team, could they?" said Hagrid anxiously. "Firs' Katie, now Ron . . ."
"I cant see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team," said
I m urge.
Wood might've done the Slytherins if he could've got away with it," said Fred fairly.
Well, I don't think it's Quidditch, but I think there's a connection between the attacks," said Hermione quietly
"How d'you work that out?" asked Fred.
"Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and weren't, although that was pure luck. And for another, neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was (supposed to be killed. Of course," she added broodingly, "that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way, because they don't seem to care how many people they finish off In lore they actually reach their victim."
Before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement, tin- dormitory doors opened again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried up the ward. They had done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward; now Mrs. Weasley seized hold of Harry and hugged him very tighty. "Dumbledore's told us how you saved him with the bezoar," she sobbed. "Oh, Harry, what can we say? You saved Ginny . . . you saved Arthur , . . now you've saved Ron
"Don't be ... I didn't. . ." muttered Harry awkwardly. "Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it," Mr. Weasley said in a constricted voice. "Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky clay for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Expirv., Harry."
Harry could not think of any reply to this and was almost gl.i?l when Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around Ron's bed; he and Hermione rose .h once to leave and Hagrid decided to go with them, leaving Ron with his family.
"It's terrible," growled Hagrid into his beard, as the three ol them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase. "Ml this new security, an kids are still gettin' hurt. . . . Dumbledoiv's worried sick. . . . He don say much, but I can tell. . . ."
"Hasn't he got any ideas, Hagrid?" asked Hermione desperately.
"I spect he's got hundreds of ideas, brain like his," said Hagrid. "But he doesn' know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine, or they'dve bin caught, wouldn they? Wha' worries me," said Hagrid, lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder (Harry, for good measure, checked the ceiling for Peeves), "is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein' attacked. Chamber o' Secrets all over again, isn' it? There'll be panic, more parents takin their kids outta school, an nex' thing yeh know the board o' governors ..."
Hagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a long-haired woman drifted serenely past, then resumed in a hoarse whisper, ". . . the board o' governors'll be talkin about shuttin' us up fer good."
"Surely not?" said Hermione, looking worried.
"Gotta see it from their point o' view," said Hagrid heavily. "I mean, it's always bin a bit of a risk sendin a kid ter Hogwarts, hasn it? Yer expect accidents, don' yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether, but attempted murder, tha's tliff'rent. 'S'no wonder Dumbledore's angry with Sn "
Hagrid stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his tangled black beard.
"What?" said Harry quickly. "Dumbledore's angry with Snape?"
"I never said tha," said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway. "Look at the time, it's gettin' on fer midnight, I need ter "
"Hagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape?" Harry asked loudly.
"Shhhh!" said Hagrid, looking both nervous and angry. "Don shout stuff like that, Harry, d'yeh wan me ter lose me job? Mind, I don' suppose yeh'd care, would yeh, not now yeh've given up Care of Mag"
"Don't try and make me feel guilty, it wont work!" said Harry forcefully. "What's Snape done?"
"I dunno, Harry, I shouldn'ta heard it at all! I  well, I was comin outta the forest the other evenin an' I overheard 'em talking well, arguin. Didn't like ter draw attention to meself, so I sorta skulked an tried not ter listen, but it was a  well, a heated discussion an' it wasn easy ter block it out."
"Well?" Harry urged him, as Hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily.
"Well  I jus' heard Snape sayin Dumbledore took too much fer granted an maybe he  Snape  didn wan ter do it any more 
"Do what?"
"I dunno, Harry, it sounded like Snape was feelin a bit overworked, tha's all  anyway, Dumbledore told him flat out he'd agreed ter do it an' that was all there was to it. Pretty firm with him. An' then he said summat abou Snape makin' investigations in his House, in Slytherin. Well, there's nothin' strange abou' that!" Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and Hermione exchanged looks full of meaning. "All the Heads o' Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business "
"Yeah, but Dumbledore's not having rows with the rest of them, is he?" said Harry.
"Look," Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands; there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two. "I know what yeh're like abou' Snape, Harry, an' I don' want yeh ter go readin' more inter this than there is."
"Look out," said Hermione tersely.
They turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner, hunchbacked, his jowls aquiver.
"Oho!" he wheezed. "Out of bed so late, this'll mean detention!"
"No it won', Filch," said Hagrid shortly. "They're with me, aren they?"
"And what difference does that make?" asked Filch obnoxiously. 
"I'm a ruddy teacher, aren' I, yeh sneakin' Squib!" said Hagrid, firing up at once.
There was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury; Mrs. Norris had arrived, unseen, and was twisting herself sinuously around Filch's skinny ankles.
"Get goin," said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth.
Harry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried off; Hagrid's and Filch's raised voices echoed behind them as they ran. They passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower, but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling, cackling and calling,
  
When there's strife and when there's trouble 
Call on Peevsie, he'll make double! 
  
The Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room. It did not seem that people knew about Ron yet; Harry was very relieved: He had been interrogated enough that day. Hermione bade him good night and set off for the girls' dormitory. Harry, however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers.
So Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all he had told Harry, in spite of his insistence that he trusted Snape completely, he had lost his temper with him. . . . He did not think that Snape had tried hard enough to investigate the Slytherins ... or, perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy?
Was it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish, to take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended there was nothing in Harry's suspicions? That seemed likely. It , might even be that Dumbledore did not want anything to distract Harry from their lessons, or from procuring that memory from Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteen-year-olds. ...
"There you are, Potter!"
Harry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had been quite convinced that the common room was empty; he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair. A closer look showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen.
"I've been waiting for you to come back," said McLaggen, disregarding Harrys drawn wand. "Mustve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn't look like he'll be fit for next week's match."
It took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking about.
"Oh . . . right. . . Quidditch," he said, putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. "Yeah ... he might not make it."
"Well, then, I'll be playing Keeper, won't I?" said McLaggen.
"Yeah," said Harry. "Yeah, I suppose so. ..."
He could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had certainly performed second-best in the trials.
"Excellent," said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. "So when's practice?"
"What? Oh . . . there's one tomorrow evening."
"Good. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand. I've got some ideas on strategy you might find useful."
"Right," said Harry unenthusiastically. "Well, I'll hear them tomorrow, then. I'm pretty tired now ... see you . . ."
The news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did not cause the sensation that Katie's attack had done. People seemed to think that it might have been an accident, given that he had been in the Potions master's room at the time, and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Slytherin.
Harry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Still checking the Marauder's Map whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary. And still there were those inexplicable times when Malfoy simply vanished from the map. . . .
But Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem, what with Quidditch practice, homework, and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown.
He could not decide which of them was more annoying. McLaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper for the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too; he was also keen to criticize the other players and provide Harry with detailed training schemes, so that more than once Harry was forced to remind him who was Captain.
Meanwhile, Lavender kept sidling up to Harry to discuss Ron, which Harry found almost more wearing than McLaggen's Quidditch lectures. At first, Lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her that Ron was in the hospital wing  "I mean, I am his girlfriend!"  but unfortunately slit-had now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots of in-depth chats with him about Ron's feelings, a most uncomfortable experience that Harry would have happily forgone.
"Look, why don't you talk to Ron about all this?" Harry asked, after a particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from precisely what Ron had said about her new drew robes to whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his relationship with Lavender to be "serious."
"Well, I would, but he's always asleep when I go and see him!" said Lavender fretfully.
"Is he?" said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of Dumbledore and Snape's row and keen m abuse McLaggen as much as possible.
"Is Hermione Granger still visiting him?" Lavender demanded suddenly.
"Yeah, I think so. Well, they're friends, aren't they?" said Harry uncomfortably.
"Friends, don't make me laugh," said Lavender scornfully. "She didn't talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he's all interesting. ..."
"Would you call getting poisoned being interesting?" asked Harry. "Anyway  sorry, got to go  there's McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch," said Harry hurriedly, and he dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take him off to Potions where, thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could follow him.
On the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, Harry dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch. Ron was very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the match, feeling it would overexcite him.
"So how's McLaggen shaping up?" he asked Harry nervously, apparently forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice.
"I've told you," said Harry patiently, "he could be world-class and I wouldn't want to keep him. He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do, he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us. I can't wait to be shot of him. And speaking of getting shot of people," Harry added, getting to his feet and picking up his Firebolt, "will you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you? She's driving me mad as well."
"Oh," said Ron, looking sheepish. "Yeah. All right."
"If you don't want to go out with her anymore, just tell her," said Harry.
"Yeah . . . well. . . it's not that easy, is it?" said Ron. He paused. "Hermione going to look in before the match?" he added casually.
"No, she's already gone down to the pitch with Ginny."
"Oh," said Ron, looking rather glum. "Right. Well, good luck. Hope you hammer McLag  I mean, Smith."
"I'll try," said Harry, shouldering his broom. "See you after the match."
He hurried down through the deserted corridors; the whole school was outside, either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it. He was looking out of the windows he passed, trying to gauge how much wind they were facing, when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw Malfoy walking toward him, accompanied by two girls, both of whom looked sulky and resentful.
Malfoy stopped short at the sight of Harry, then gave a short, humorless laugh and continued walking.
"Where're you going?" Harry demanded.
"Yeah, I'm really going to tell you, because it's your business, Potter," sneered Malfoy. "You'd better hurry up, they'll be waiting for 'the Chosen Captain'  'the Boy Who Scored'  whatever they call you these days."
One of the girls gave an unwilling giggle. Harry stared at her. She blushed. Malfoy pushed past Harry and she and her friend followed at a trot, turning the corner and vanishing from view.
Harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear. This was infuriating; he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest of the school was absent: Harry's best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to. The silent seconds trickled past, and Harry remained where he was, frozen, gazing at the place where Malfoy had vanished. . . .
"Where have you been?" demanded Ginny, as Harry sprinted into the changing rooms. The whole team was changed and ready; Coote and Peakes, the Beaters, were both hitting their clubs nervously against their legs.
"I met Malfoy," Harry told her quietly, as he pulled his scarlet robes over his head.
"So I wanted to know how come he's up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here. ..."
"Does it matter right now?"
"Well, I'm not likely to find out, am I?" said Harry, seizing his Firebolt and pushing his glasses straight. "Come on then!"
And without another word, he marched out onto the pitch to deafening cheers and boos.
There was little wind; the clouds were patchy; every now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight.
"Tricky conditions!" McLaggen said bracingly to the team. "Coote, Peakes, you'll want to fly out of the sun, so they don't see you coming "
"I'm the Captain, McLaggen, shut up giving them instructions," said Harry angrily. "Just get up by the goal posts!"
Once McLaggen had marched off, Harry turned to Coote and Peakes.
"Make sure you do fly out of the sun," he told them grudgingly.
He shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and then, on Madam Hooch's whistle, kicked off and rose into the air, higher than the rest of his team, streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch. If he could catch it good and early, there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle, seize the Marauder's Map, and find out what Malfoy was doing. . . .
"And that's Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle," said a dreamy voice, echoing over the grounds. "He did the commentary last time, of course, and Ginny Weasley flew into him, I think probably on purpose, it looked like it. Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor, I expect he regrets that now he's playing them  oh, look, he's lost the Quaffle, Ginny took it from him, I do like her, she's very nice. ..."
Harry stared down at the commentator's podium. Surely nobody in their right mind would have let Luna Lovegood commentate? But even from above there was no mistaking that long, dirty-blonde hair, nor the necklace of butterbeer corks. . . . Beside Luna, Professor McGonagall was looking slightly uncomfortable, as though she was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment.
". . . but now that big Hufflepuff player's got the Quaffle from , her, I can't remember his name, it's something like Bibble  no, Buggins "
"It's Cadwallader!" said Professor McGonagall loudly from beside Luna. The crowd laughed.
Harry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign of it. Moments later, Cadwallader scored. McLaggen had been shouting criticism at Ginny for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession, with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear.
"McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you're supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!" bellowed Harry, wheeling around to face his Keeper.
"You're not setting a great example!" McLaggen shouted back, red-faced and furious.
"And Harry Potter's now having an argument with his Keeper," said Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs and Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered. "I don't think that'll help him find the Snitch, but maybe it's a clever ruse. ..."
Swearing angrily, Harry spun round and set off around the pitch again, scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny, winged golden ball.
Ginny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the red-and-gold-clad supporters below something to cheer about. Then Cadwallader scored again, making things level, but Luna did not seem to have noticed; she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score, and kept attempting to draw the crowd's attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that Zacharias Smith, who had so far failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering from something called "Loser's Lurgy."
"Seventy-forty to Hufflepuff!" barked Professor McGonagall into Luna's megaphone.
"Is it, already?" said Luna vaguely. "Oh, look! The Gryffindor Keeper's got hold of one of the Beater's bats."
Harry spun around in midair. Sure enough, McLaggen, for reasons best known to himself, had pulled Peakes's bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an oncoming Cadwallader.
"Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts!" roared Harry, pelting toward McLaggen just as McLaggen took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and mishit it.
A blinding, sickening pain ... a flash of light. . . distant screams . . . and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel. . .
And the next thing Harry knew, he was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling. He raised his head awkwardly. There on his left was a familiar-looking, freckly, red-haired person.
"Nice of you to drop in," said Ron, grinning.
Harry blinked and looked around. Of course: He was in the hospital wing. The sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson. The match must have finished hours ago ... as had any hope of cornering Malfoy. Harry's head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages.
"What happened?"
"Cracked skull," said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows. "Nothing to worry about, I mended it at once, but I'm keeping you in overnight. You shouldn't over exert yourself for a few hours."
"I don't want to stay here overnight," said Harry angrily, sitting up and throwing back his covers. "I want to find McLaggen and kill him."
"I'm afraid that would come under the heading of 'overexertion,'" said Madam Pomfrey, pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner. "You will stay here until I discharge you, Potter, or I shall call the headmaster."
She bustled back into her office, and Harry sank back into his pillows, fuming.
"D'you know how much we lost by?" he asked Ron through clenched teeth.
"Well, yeah I do," said Ron apologetically. "Final score was three hundred and twenty to sixty."
"Brilliant," said Harry savagely. "Really brilliant! When I get hold of McLaggen "
"You don't want to get hold of him, he's the size of a troll," said
Ron reasonably. "Personally, I think there's a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Prince's. Anyway, the rest of the team might've dealt with him before you get out of here, they're not happy. ..."
There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Rons voice; Harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so badly. Harry lay there, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, his recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging.
"I could hear the match commentary from here," said Ron, his voice now shaking with laughter. "I hope Luna always commentates from now on. . . . Loser's Lurgy ..."
But Harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation, and after a while Ron's snorts subsided.
"Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious," he said, after a long pause, and Harry's imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in which Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing. . . ."She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match. How come? You left here early enough."
"Oh . . ." said Harry, as the scene in his mind's eye imploded. "Yeah . . . well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn't look like they wanted to be with him, and that's the second time he's made sure he isn't down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; he skipped the last match too, remember?" Harry sighed. "Wish I'd followed him now, the match was such a fiasco. . . ."
"Don't be stupid," said Ron sharply. "You couldn't have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy, you're the Captain!"
"I want to know what he's up to," said Harry. "And don't tell nn its all in my head, not after what I overheard between him and Snape "
"I never said it was all in your head," said Ron, hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning at Harry, "but there's no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place! You're getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, thinking about missing a match just to follow him ..."
"I want to catch him at it!" said Harry in frustration. "I mean, where's he going when he disappears off the map?"
"I dunno . . . Hogsmeade?" suggested Ron, yawning.
"I've never seen him going along any of the secret passageway on the map. I thought they were being watched now anyway?"
"Well then, I dunno," said Ron.
Silence fell between them. Harry stared up at the circle of lamp light above him, thinking. . . .
If only he had Rufus Scrimgeour's power, he would have been able to set a tail upon Malfoy, but unfortunately Harry did not have an office full of Aurors at his command. . . . He thought fleetingly of trying to set something up with the D.A., but there again was the problem that people would be missed from lessons; most of them, after all, still had full schedules. . . .
There was a low, rumbling snore from Ron's bed. After a while Madam Pomfrey came out of her office, this time wearing a thick dressing gown. It was easiest to feign sleep; Harry rolled over onto his side and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as she waved her wand. The lamps dimmed, and she returned to her office; he heard the door click behind her and knew that she was off to bed.
This was, Harry reflected in the darkness, the third time that he had been brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch injury. Last time he had fallen off his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch, and the time before that, all the bones had been removed from his arm by the incurably inept Professor Lockhart. . . . That had been his most painful injury by far ... he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night, a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the 
Harry sat bolt upright, his heart pounding, his bandage turban askew. He had the solution at last: There was a way to have Malfoy followed  how could he have forgotten, why hadn't he thought
of it before?
But the question was, how to call him? What did you do? Quietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into the darkness.
"Kreacher?"
There was a very loud crack, and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room. Ron awoke with a yelp.
"What's going  ?"
Harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfrey's office and muttered, "Muffliato!" so that she would not come running. Then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at
what was going on.
Two house-elves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory, one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats, the other, a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth. Then there was another loud bang, and Peeves the Poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves.
"I was watching that, Potty!" he told Harry indignantly, pointing at the fight below, before letting out a loud cackle. "Look at the ickle creatures squabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy "
"Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby, no he won't, or Dobby will shut Kreacher's mouth for him!" cried Dobby in a high-pitched voice.
" kicky, scratchy!" cried Peeves happily, now pelting bits of' chalk at the elves to enrage them further. "Tweaky, pokey!"
"Kreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh yes, and what a master he is, filthy friend of Mudbloods, oh, what would poor Kreacher's mistress say  ?"
Exactly what Kreacher's mistress would have said they did not find out, for at that moment Dobby sank his knobbly little fist into Kreachers mouth and knocked out half of his teeth. Harry and Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though they continued to try and kick and punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped around the lamp squealing, "Stick your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies "
Harry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, "Langlock!" Peeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth.
"Nice one," said Ron appreciatively, lifting Dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with Kreacher. "That was another Prince hex, wasn't it?"
"Yeah," said Harry, twisting Kreacher's wizened arm into a half nelson. "Right  I'm forbidding you to fight each other! Well, Kreacher, you're forbidden to fight Dobby. Dobby, I know I'm not allowed to give you orders "
"Dobby is a free house-elf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Potter wants him to do!" said Dobby, tears now streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper.
"Okay then," said Harry, and he and Ron both released the elves, who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting.
"Master called me?" croaked Kreacher, sinking into a bow even as he gave Harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death.
"Yeah, I did," said Harry, glancing toward Madam Pomfrey's office door to check that the Muffliato spell was still working; there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion. "I've got a job for you."
"Kreacher will do whatever Master wants," said Kreacher, sinking so low that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes, "because Kreacher has no choice, but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master, yes "
"Dobby will do it, Harry Potter!" squeaked Dobby, his tennis-ball-sized eyes still swimming in tears. "Dobby would be honored to help Harry Potter!"
"Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of you," said Harry. "Okay then ... I want you to tail Draco Malfoy."
Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Ron's face, Harry went on, "I want to know where he's going, who he's meeting, and what he's doing. I want you to follow him around the
clock."
"Yes, Harry Potter!" said Dobby at once, his great eyes shining with excitement. "And if Dobby does it wrong, Dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower, Harry Potter!"
"There won't be any need for that," said Harry hastily.
"Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys?" croaked Kreacher. "Master wants me to spy upon the pure-blood great-nephew of my old mistress?"
"That's the one," said Harry, foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediately. "And you're forbidden to tip him off, Kreacher, or to show him what you're up to, or to talk to him at all, or to write him messages or ... or to contact him in any way. Got it?"
He thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the instructions he had just been given and waited. After a moment or two, and to Harrys great satisfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply again and said, with bitter resentment, "Master thinks of everything, and Kreacher must obey him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy boy, oh yes. . . ."
"That's settled, then," said Harry. "I'll want regular reports, but make sure I'm not surrounded by people when you turn up. Ron and Hermione are okay. And don't tell anyone what you're doing. Just stick to Malfoy like a couple of wart plasters."
 

Chapter 20: Lord Voldemort's Request
Harry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on Monday morning, restored to full health by the ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned, the best of which was that Hermione was friends with Ron again. Hermione even escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that Ginny had argued with Dean. The drowsing creature in Harry's chest suddenly raised its head, sniffing the air hopefully. 
  
"What did they row about?" he asked, trying to sound casual as they turned onto a seventh-floor corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus. She looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was carrying. 
"It's all right!" said Hermione kindly, hurrying forward to help her. "Here ..." 
  
She tapped the broken scales with her wand and said, "Reparo." The girl did not say thank you, but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight; Ron glanced back at her. 
  
"I swear they're getting smaller," he said. 
"Never mind her," said Harry, a little impatiently. "What did Ginny and Dean row about, Hermione?" 
"Oh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludgu at you," said Hermione. 
  
"It must've looked funny," said Ron reasonably. "It didn't look funny at all!" said Hermione hotly. "It looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes hadn't caught Harry he could have been very badly hurt!" 
  
"Yeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it," said Harry, still trying to sound casual. "Or are they still together?" 
  
"Yes, they are  but why are you so interested?" asked Hermione, giving Harry a sharp look. 
  
"I just don't want my Quidditch team messed up again!" he said hastily, but Hermione continued to look suspicious, and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called, "Harry!" giving him an excuse to turn his back on her. "Oh, hi, Luna." 
  
- "I went to the hospital wing to find you," said Luna, rummaging in her bag. "But they said you'd left..." 
She thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large spotted toadstool, and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Ron's hands, finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to Harry. 
  
". . . I've been told to give you this." 
  
It was a small roll of parchment, which Harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with Dumbledore. 
  
"Tonight," he told Ron and Hermione, once he had unrolled it. 
  
"Nice commentary last match!" said Ron to Luna as she took back the green onion, the toadstool, and the cat litter. Luna smiled vaguely. 
  
"You're making fun of me, aren't you?" she said. "Everyone says I was dreadful." 
  
"No, I'm serious!" said Ron earnestly. "I can't remember enjoying commentary more! What is this, by the way?" he added, holding the onionlike object up to eye level. 
  
"Oh, it's a Gurdyroot," she said, stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag. "You can keep it if you like, I've got a few of them. They're really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies." And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the Gurdyroot. 
  
"You know, she's grown on me, Luna," he said, as they set off again for the Great Hall. "I know she's insane, but it's in a good " He stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous. "Hi," said Ron nervously. 
  
"C'mon," Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped past, though not before they had heard Lavender say, "Why didn't you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?" 
  
Ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together. Hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Harry's Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work. 
  
"Thanks a lot, Hermione," said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o'clock. "Listen, Ive got to hurry or I'll be late for Dumbledore. ..." 
  
She did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmasters office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight. 
  
"Enter," called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside. There stood Professor Trelawney. 
  
"Aha!" she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles. 
  
"So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!" 
  
"My dear Sybill," said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice, "there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment, and I really don't think there is any more to be said " 
  
"Very well," said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice. "If you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it. ... 
  
Perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated. ..." 
  
She pushed past Harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase; they heard her stumble halfway down, and Harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls. 
  
"Please close the door and sit down, Harry," said Dumbledore, sounding rather tired. 
  
Harry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledore's desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory. 
  
"Professor Trelawney still isn't happy Firenze is teaching, then?" Harry asked. 
  
"No," said Dumbledore, "Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself. I cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest, where he is now an outcast, nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know  and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her  that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see." 
  
Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, "But never mind my staffing problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly  have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?" 
  
"Ah," said Harry, brought up short. What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up to, Harry had almost forgotten about the memory Dumbledore had asked him to extract from Professor Slughorn. "Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn't give it to me." There was a little silence. 
  
"I see," said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. "And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?" 
  
"Well," Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. "Well . . . the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood " "And did that work?" asked Dumbledore. "Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned " " which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it." 
  
A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harrys head all the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything. 
  
"Sir," he said, a little desperately, "it isn't that I wasn't bothered or anything, I've just had other  other things . . ." 
  
"Other things on your mind," Dumbledore finished the sentence for him. "I see." 
  
Silence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced with Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on, punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledore's head. Harry felt strangely diminished, as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. When he could stand it no longer he said, "Professor Dumbledore, I'm really sorry. I should have done more. ... I should have realized you wouldn't have asked me to do it if it wasn't really important." 
  
"Thank you for saying that, Harry," said Dumbledore quietly. "May I hope, then, that you will give this matter higher priority from now on? There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory." 
  
"I'll do it, sir, I'll get it from him," he said earnestly. 
  
"Then we shall say no more about it just now," said Dumbledore more kindly, "but continue with our story where we left off. You remember where that was?" 
  
"Yes, sir," said Harry quickly. "Voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it. Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked ... he asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes," he mumbled shamefacedly. 
  
"Very good," said Dumbledore. "Now, you will remember, I hope, that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation?" 
  
  
Yes, sir. 
"Thus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen?" 
  
Harry nodded. 
  
"But now, Harry," said Dumbledore, "now things become murkier and stranger. If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle, it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether there is a soul alive, apart from himself, who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts. However, I have two last memories that I would like to share with you." Dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the Pensieve. "I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely." 
  
The idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made Harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux memory, and he shifted guiltily in his seat as Dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it. 
  
"I hope you are not tired of diving into other people's memories, for they are curious recollections, these two," he said. "This first one came from a very old house-elf by the name of Hokey. Before we see what Hokey witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts. 
  
"He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes." 
  
"At Borgin and Burkes?" Harry repeated, stunned. 
  
"At Borgin and Burkes," repeated Dumbledore calmly. "I think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokey's memory. But this was not Voldemort's first choice of job. Hardly anyone knew of it at the time  I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided  but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher." 
  
"He wanted to stay here? Why?" asked Harry, more amazed still. 
  
"I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet," said Dumbledore. "Firstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home." 
  
Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too. 
  
"Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place, but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap. 
  
"And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards. Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best terms, who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin to build himself an army." 
  
"But he didn't get the job, sir?" 
  
"No, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to teach." 
  
"How did you feel about that, sir?" asked Harry hesitantly. "Deeply uneasy," said Dumbledore. "I had advised Armando against the appointment  I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a position of power." 
  
"Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?" 
  
Somehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it. 
  
"Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years. 
  
"So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this." 
  
"I'll bet he was," said Harry, unable to contain himself. 
  
"Well, quite," said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. "And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith." 
  
Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, "After you, Harry." 
  
Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them. He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. She was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest house-elf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers. 
"Hurry up, Hokey!" said Hepzibah imperiously. "He said he'd come at four, it's only a couple of minutes to and he's never been late yet!" 
  
She tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened up. The top of the elf's head barely reached the seat of Hepzibah's chair, and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga. 
  
"How do I look?" said Hepzibah, turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror. 
  
"Lovely, madam," squeaked Hokey. 
  
Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokeys contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion. 
  
A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped. 
  
"Quick, quick, he's here, Hokey!" cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room, which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things: There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of gold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers. In fact, the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory. 
  
The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him; he looked more handsome than ever. He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibah's fat little hand, brushing it with his lips. 
  
"I brought you flowers," he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from nowhere. 
  
"You naughty boy, you shouldn't have!" squealed old Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. "You do spoil this old lady, Tom. ... Sit down, sit down. . . . Where's Hokey? Ah ..." 
  
The house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistress's elbow. 
  
"Help yourself, Tom," said Hepzibah, "I know how you love my cakes. Now, how are you? You look pale. They overwork you at that shop, I've said it a hundred times. ..." 
  
Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered. .|,! 
  
"Well, what's your excuse for visiting this time?" she asked, bat-ring her lashes. 
  
"Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor," said Voldemort. "Five hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair " 
  
"Now, now, not so fast, or Ill think you're only here for my trinkets!" pouted Hepzibah. 
  
"I am ordered here because of them," said Voldemort quietly. "I am only a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire " 
  
"Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!" said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. "I've something to show you that I've never shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will you promise you won't tell Mr. Burke I've got it? He'd never let me rest if he knew I'd shown it to you, and I'm not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom, you'll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you can get for it." 
  
"I'd be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me," said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle. 
  
"I had Hokey bring it out for me . . . Hokey, where are you? I want to show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure. ... In fact, bring both, while you're at it. ..." 
  
"Here, madam," squeaked the house-elf, and Harry saw two leather boxes, one on top of the other, moving across the room as if of their own volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables, ***pouffes, and footstools. 
  
"Now," said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them in her lap, and preparing to open the topmost one, "I think you'll like this, Tom. . . . Oh, if my family knew I was showing you. . . . They can't wait to get their hands on this!" 
  
She opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles. 
  
"I wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a good look!" whispered Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a long-fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings. Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibahs face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemort's handsome features. 
"A badger," murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving upon the cup. "Then this was . . . ?" 
  
"Helga Hufflepuff 's, as you very well know, you clever boy!" said Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek. "Didn't I tell you I was distantly descended? This has been handed down in the family for years and years. Lovely, isn't it? And all sorts of powers it's supposed to possess too, but I haven't tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. . . ." 
  
She hooked the cup back off Voldemort's long forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort's face as the cup was taken away. 
  
"Now then," said Hepzibah happily, "wheres Hokey? Oh yes, there you are  take that away now, Hokey." 
  
The elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap. 
"I think you'll like this even more, Tom," she whispered. "Lean in a little, dear boy, so you can see. . . . Of course, Burke knows I've got this one, I bought it from him, and I daresay he'd love to get it back when I'm gone. ..." 
  
She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket. 
  
Voldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it. 
  
"Slytherin's mark," he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate, serpentine S. 
  
"That's right!" said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. "I had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn't let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a ragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value " 
  
There was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort's eyes flashed scarlet at the words, and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locket's chain. 
  
" I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are. . . . Pretty, isn't it? And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe. . . ." 
  
She reached out to take the locket back. For a moment, Harry thought Voldemort was not going to let go of it, but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion. 
  
So there you are, Tom, clear, and I hope you enjoyed that! 
  
She looked him full in the face and for the first time, Harry saw her foolish smile falter. 
  
"Are you all right, dear?" 
  
"Oh yes," said Voldemort quietly. "Yes, I'm very well. ..." 
  
I thought  but a trick of the light, I suppose " said Hepzibah, looking unnerved, and Harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in Voldemort's eyes. "Here, Hokey, take these away and lock them up again. ... The usual enchantments..." 
  
"Time to leave, Harry," said Dumbledore quietly, and as the in tie elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to Dumbledore's office. 
  
"Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene," said Dumbledore, resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same. "Hokey the house-elf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistress's evening cocoa by accident." 
  
"No way!" said Harry angrily. 
  
"I see we are of one mind," said Dumbledore. "Certainly, then are many similarities between this death and that of the Riddles. In both cases, somebody else took the blame, someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death " "Hokey confessed?" 
  
"She remembered putting something in her mistress's cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and little-known poison, said Dumbledore. "It was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and confused " 
  
"Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!" "Yes, that is my conclusion too," said Dumbledore. "And, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey " 
  
" because she was a house-elf," said Harry. He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W. "Precisely," said Dumbledore. "She was old, she admitted to having tampered with the drink, and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over  but her memory, of course, proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket. 
  
"By the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibah's family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing. It took them a while to be sure of this, for she had many hiding places, having always guarded her collection most jealously. But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had no idea where he had gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance. And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long time. 
  
"Now," said Dumbledore, "if you don't mind, Harry, I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor, besotted, old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage, just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfins ring, so he ran off now with Hepzibahs cup and locket." 
  
"But," said Harry, frowning, "it seems mad. . . . Risking everything, throwing away his job, just for those . . ." 
  
"Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort," said Dumbledore. "I hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him, Harry, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully his." "The locket maybe," said Harry, "but why take the cup as well?" 
  
"It had belonged to another of Hogwartss founders," said Dumbledore. "I think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history. There were other reasons, I think. ... I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course. 
  
"And now for the very last recollection I have to show you, at least until you manage to retrieve Professor Slughorn's memory for us. Ten years separates Hokeys memory and this one, ten years during which we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing. . . ." Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore emptied the last memory into the Pensieve. 
  
"Whose memory is it?" he asked. "Mine," said Dumbledore. 
  
And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver mass, landing in the very office he had just left. There was Fawkes slumbering happily on his perch, and there behind the desk was Dumbledore, who looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing beside Harry, though both hands were whole and undamaged and his face was, perhaps, a little less lined. The one difference between the present-day office and this one was that it was snowing in the past; bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge. 
  
The younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something, and sure enough, moments after their arrival, there was a knock on the door and he said, "Enter." 
  
Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snake-like, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders. 
  
The Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise. Evidently this visit had been made by appointment. 
  
"Good evening, Tom," said Dumbledore easily. "Won't you sit down?" 
  
"Thank you," said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which Dumbledore had gestured  the very seat, by the looks of it, that Harry had just vacated in the present. "I heard that you had become headmaster," he said, and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been. "A worthy choice." 
  
"I am glad you approve," said Dumbledore, smiling. "May I offer you a drink?" 
  
"That would be welcome," said Voldemort. "I have come a long way." 
  
Dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the Pensieve, but which then was full of bottles. Having handed Voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself, he returned to the seat behind his desk. . "So, Tom ... to what do I owe the pleasure?" 
  
Voldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine. 
  
"They do not call me 'Tom' anymore," he said. "These days, 1 am known as " 
  
"I know what you are known as," said Dumbledore, smiling, pleasantly. "But to me, I'm afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite forget their charges' youthful beginnings." 
  
He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: Dumbledore's refusal to use Voldemorts chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such. 
  
"I am surprised you have remained here so long," said Voldemort after a short pause. "I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school." 
  
"Well," said Dumbledore, still smiling, "to a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of teaching too." 
  
"I see it still," said Voldemort. "I merely wondered why you  who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister " 
  
"Three times at the last count, actually," said Dumbledore. "But the Ministry never attracted me as a career. Again, something we have in common, I think." 
  
Voldemort inclined his head, unsmiling, and took another sip of wine. Dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now, but waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for Voldemort to talk first. 
  
"I have returned," he said, after a little while, "later, perhaps, than Professor Dippet expected . . . but I have returned, nevertheless, to request again what he once told me I was too young to have. I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle, to teach. I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place. I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard." 
  
Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking. 
  
"Yes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us," he said quietly. "Rumors of your doings have reached your old school, Tom. I should be sorry to believe half of them." 
  
Voldemort's expression remained impassive as he said, "Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. You must know this, Dumbledore." 
  
"You call it 'greatness,' what you have been doing, do you?" asked Dumbledore delicately. 
  
"Certainly," said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. "I have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed " 
  
"Of some kinds of magic," Dumbledore corrected him quietly. "Of some. Of others, you remain . . . forgive me . . . woefully ignorant." 
  
For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of rage. 
  
"The old argument," he said softly. "But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore." 
  
"Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places," suggested Dumbledore. 
  
"Well, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than here, at Hogwarts?" said Voldemort. "Will you let me return? Will you let me share my knowledge with your students? I place myself and my talents at your disposal. I am yours to command." 
  
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. "And what will become of those whom you command? What will happen to those who call themselves  or so rumor has it  the Death Eaters?" 
  
Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know this name; he saw Voldemorts eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare. 
  
"My friends," he said, after a moment's pause, "will carry on without me, I am sure." 
  
"I am glad to hear that you consider them friends," said Dumbledore. "I was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants." 
  
"You are mistaken," said Voldemort. 
  
"Then if I were to go to the Hog's Head tonight, I would not find a group of them  Nott, Rosier, Muldber, Dolohov  awaiting your return? Devoted friends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy night, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post." 
  
There could be no doubt that Dumbledore's detailed knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to Voldemort; however, he rallied almost at once. 
  
"You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore." 
  
"Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen," said Dumbledore lightly. "Now, Tom . . ." 
  
Dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat, the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture. 
  
"Let us speak openly. Why have you come here tonight, surrounded by henchmen, to request a job we both know you do not want?" 
Voldemort looked coldly surprised. "A job I do not want? On the contrary, Dumbledore, I want it very much." 
  
"Oh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen. What is it you're after, Tom? Why not try an open request for once?" 
  
Voldemort sneered. "If you do not want to give me a job " 
  
"Of course I don't," said Dumbledore. "And I don't think for a moment you expected me to. Nevertheless, you came here, you asked, you must have had a purpose." 
  
Voldemort stood up. He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever, his features thick with rage. "This is your final word?" 
  
"It is," said Dumbledore, also standing. 
  
"Then we have nothing more to say to each other." 
  
"No, nothing," said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face. "The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom. ... I wish I could. . . ." 
  
For a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning: He was sure that Voldemort's hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand; but then the moment had passed, Voldemort had turned away, the door was closing, and he was gone. 
  
Harry felt Dumbledore's hand close over his arm again and moments later, they were standing together on almost the same spot, but there was no snow building on the window ledge, and Dumbledore's hand was blackened and dead-looking once more. 
  
"Why?" said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore's face. "Why did he come back? Did you ever find out?" 
  
"I have ideas," said Dumbledore, "but no more than that." 
  
"What ideas, sir?" 
  
"I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn," said Dumbledore. 
  
"When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear ... to both of us." 
  
Harry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at once. 
  
"Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn't say. ..." 
  
"Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job," said Dumbledore. "The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort." 

Chapter 21: The Unknowable Room
Harry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had done so many times before. 
  
"You won't find anything in there," said Hermione firmly, late on Sunday evening. 
  
"Don't start, Hermione," said Harry. "If it hadn't been for the Prince, Ron wouldn't be sitting here now." 
  
"He would if you'd just listened to Snape in our first year," said Hermione dismissively. 
  
Harry ignored her. He had just found an incantation Sectum-sempra!" scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words "For enemies," and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page. They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other people awake were fellow sixth years. There had been a cer-tain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test. Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twenty-first of April, had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions, which would take place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade. 
  
Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not man-aged to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. Hermione, who had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but Harry, who would not be seventeen for an-other four months, could not take the test whether ready or not.
  
"At least you can Apparate, though!" said Ron tensely. "You'll have no trouble come July!" 
  
"I've only done it once," Harry reminded him; he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson. 
  
Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and Hermione had already completed. Harry fully expected to receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle dementors, but he did not care: Slughorns memory was the most important thing to him now. 
  
"I'm telling you, the stupid Prince isn't going to be able to help you with this, Harry!" said Hermione, more loudly. "There's only one way to force someone to do what you want, and that's the Imperius Curse, which is illegal " 
  
"Yeah, I know that, thanks," said Harry, not looking up from the book. "That's why I'm looking for something different. Dumbledorf says Veritaserum won't do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a spell. . . ." 
  
"You're going about it the wrong way," said Hermione. "Only you can get the memory, Dumbledore says. That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where other people cant. It's not a question of slipping him a potion, anyone could do that " 
  
"How do you spell 'belligerent'?" said Ron, shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchment. "It can't be B  U  M " 
  
"No, it isn't," said Hermione, pulling Ron's essay toward her. "And 'augury' doesn't begin O  R  G either. What kind of quill are you using?" 
  
"It's one of Fred and George's Spell-Check ones, but I think the charm must be wearing off." 
  
"Yes, it must," said Hermione, pointing at the title of his essay, "because we were asked how we'd deal with dementors, not 'Dug-bogs', and I don't remember you changing your name to 'Roonil Wazlib either." 
  
"Ah no!" said Ron, staring horror-struck at the parchment. "Don't say I'll have to write the whole thing out again!" 
  
"It's okay, we can fix it," said Hermione, pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand.
  
"I love you, Hermione," said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rub-bing his eyes wearily. Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, "Don't let Lavender hear you saying that." 
  
"1 won't," said Ron into his hands. "Or maybe I will, then she'll ditch me." 
  
"Why don't you ditch her if you want to finish it?" asked Harry. 
  
"You haven't ever chucked anyone, have you?" said Ron. "You and Cho just "
  
"Sort of fell apart, yeah," said Harry.
  
"Wish that would happen with me and Lavender," said Ron gloomily, watching Hermione silently tapping each of his mis-spelled words with the end of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page. "But the more I hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. It's like going out with the giant squid." 
  
"There," said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ron's essay. 
  
"Thanks a million," said Ron. "Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion?" Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince's notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using Hermione's quill. Harry had just closed the Half-Blood Prince's book, yawning, when  
  
Crack! 
  
Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay, and Harry said, "Kreacher!" 
  
The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes. "Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing, so Kreacher has come to give--"
  
Crack!
  
Dobby appeared alongside Kreacher, his tea-cozy hat askew. "Dobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!" he squeaked, cast-ing Kreacher a resentful look. "And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their re-ports together!" 
  
"What is this?" asked Hermione, still looking shocked by these sudden appearances. "What's going on, Harry?" Harry hesitated before answering, because he had not told Her-mione about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail Malfoy; house-elves were always such a touchy subject with her. 
  
"Well. . . they've been following Malfoy for me," he said.
  
"Night and day," croaked Kreacher.
  
"Dobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!" said Dobby proudly, swaying where he stood. Hermione looked indignant. 
  
"You haven't slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you didn't tell him not to "
  
"No, of course I didn't," said Harry quickly. "Dobby, you can sleep, all right? But has either of you found out anything?" he has-tened to ask, before Hermione could intervene again.
  
"Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood," croaked Kreacher at once. "His features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of"
  
"Draco Malfoy is a bad boy!" squeaked Dobby angrily. "A bad boy who  who " He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire, as though about to dive into it. Harry, to whom this was not entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle and held him fast. For a few seconds Dobby struggled, then went limp.
  
"Thank you, Harry Potter," he panted. "Dobby still finds it dif-ficult to speak ill of his old masters." Harry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to Kreacher, "But Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a house-elf!" 
  
"Yeah, we don't need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy," Harry told Kreacher. "Let's fast forward to where he's actually been going." 
  
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, "Master Malfoy eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dun-geons, he attends his classes in a variety of" 
  
"Dobby, you tell me," said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. "Has he been going anywhere he shouldn't have?" 
  
"Harry Potter, sir," squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight, "the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him while he enters " 
  
"The Room of Requirement!" said Harry, smacking himself hard on the forehead with Advanced Potion-Making. Hermione and Ron stared at him. "That's where he's been sneaking off to! That's where he's doing whatever he's doing! And I bet that's why he's been disappearing off the map  come to think of it, I've never seen the Room of Requirement on there!" 
  
"Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there," said Ron. 
  
"I think it'll be part of the magic of the room," said Hermione. "If you need it to be unplottable, it will be."
  
"Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy's doing?" said Harry eagerly.
  
"No, Harry Potter, that is impossible," said Dobby. 
  
"No, it's not," said Harry at once. "Malfoy got into our head-quarters there last year, so I'll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem." 
  
"But I don't think you will, Harry," said Hermione slowly. "Mal-foy already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn't he, because that stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you don't know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there, so you don't know what to ask it to transform into." 
  
"There'll be a way around that," said Harry dismissively. "You've done brilliantly, Dobby."
  
"Kreachers done well too," said Hermione kindly; but far from looking grateful, Kreacher averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, "The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear " 
  
"Get out of it," Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher made one last deep bow and Disapparated. "You'd better go and get some sleep too, Dobby." 
  
"Thank you, Harry Potter, sir!" squeaked Dobby happily, and he too vanished. 
  
"How good is this?" said Harry enthusiastically, turning to Ron and Hermione the moment the room was elf-free again. "We know where Malfoy's going! We've got him cornered now!"
  
"Yeah, it's great," said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink chat had recently been an almost com-pleted essay. Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand. 
  
"But what's all this about him going up there with a variety of students'?" said Hermione. "How many people are in on it? You wouldn't think he'd trust lots of them to know what he's do-ing---" 
  
"Yeah, that is weird," said Harry, frowning. "I heard him telling Crabbe it wasn't Crabbe's business what he was doing... so what's he telling all these... all these..." Harry's voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire. "God, I've been stupid," he said quietly. "Its obvious, isn't it? There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He couldve nicked some any time during that lesson. . . ." 
  
"Nicked what?" said Ron.
  
"Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slug-horn showed us in our first Potions lesson There aren't a whole variety of students standing guard for Malfoy it's just Crabbe and Goyle as usual. Yeah, it all fits!" said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire. "They're stupid enough to do what they're told even if he won't tell them what he's up to, but he doesn't want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement, so he's got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like other people Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch  ha! Crabbe and Goyle!" 
  
Do you mean to say," said Hermione in a hushed voice, "that that little girl whose scales I repaired  ?"
  
"Yeah, of course!" said Harry loudly, staring at her. "Of course! Malfoy must've been inside the room at the time, so she  what am I talking about?  he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to corne out, because there was someone there! And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too! We've been walking past him all the time and not realizing it!" 
  
"He's got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls?" guffawed Ron. "Blimey no wonder they don't look too happy these days. I'm surprised they don't tell him to stuff it." 
  
"Well, they wouldn't, would they, if he's shown them his Dark Mark?" said Harry. 
  
"Hmmm... the Dark Mark we don't know exists," said Hermi-one skeptically, rolling up Ron's dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him. 
  
"We'll see said Harry confidently. 
  
"Yes, we will," Hermione said, getting to her feet and stretching. "But, Harry, before you get all excited, I still don't think you'll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what's there first'. And I don't think you should forget"  she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look  "that what you're supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn. Good night." 
  
Harry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. Once the door to the girls' dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on Ron. "What d'you think?" 
  
"Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf," said Ron, staring at the spot where Dobby had vanished. "I'd have that Apparition Test in the bag." 
  
Harry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like hours, wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement and what he, Harry, would see when he went in there the following day, for whatever Hermione said, Harry was sure that if Malfoy had-=- been able to see the headquarters of the D.A., he would be able to see Malfoy's, what could it be? A meeting place? A hideout? A ston room? A workshop? Harrys mind worked feverishly and his dreams, when he finally fell asleep, were broken and disturbed by images of Malfoy, who turned into Slughorn, who turned into Snape 
  
Harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning; he had a free period before Defense Against the Dark Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of Requirement. Hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the room, which irritated Harry, because he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to. 
  
"Look," he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a hand on the Daily Prophet, which she had just removed from a post owl, to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it. "I haven't for-gotten about Slughorn, but I haven't got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why shouldn't I find out what Malfoy's doing?" 
  
"I've already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn," said Her-mione. "It's not a question of tricking him or bewitching him, or Dumbledore could have done it in a second. Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement"  she jerked the Prophet out from under Harrys hand and unfolded it to look at the front page  "you should go and find Slughorn and start appeal-ing to his better nature." 
  
"Anyone we know  ?" asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the headlines.
  
"Yes!" said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to gag on their breakfast. "But it's all right, he's not dead  its Mundungus, he's been arrested and sent to Azkaban! Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary, and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished. Oh, and how horrible, a nine-year-old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think he was under the Imperius Curse." 
  
They finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set off imme-diately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on Snape's dementor essay, and Harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet. 
  
Harry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage, but he need not have bothered. When he reached his destination he found it deserted. Harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with Malfoy in-side it or out, but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl. 
  
He closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of Requirement's door was concealed. He knew what he had to do; he had become most accomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all his might he thought, I need to see what Malfoy's doing in here... I need to see what Malfoy's doing in here... I need to see what Malfoy's doing in here... 
  
Three times he walked past the door; then, his heart pounding with excitement, he opened his eyes and faced it  but he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall. He moved forward and gave it an experimental push. The stone remained solid and unyielding. 
  
"Okay," said Harry aloud. "Okay... I thought the wrong thing..." He pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes closed, con-centrating as hard as he could. I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly... I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly... After three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly. 
  
There was no door.
  
"Oh, come off it," he told the wall irritably. "That was a clear instruction. Fine." He thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more. I need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy... 
  
He did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling; he was listening hard, as though he might hear the door pop into existence. He heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering of birds outside. He opened his eyes. 
  
There was still no door.
  
Harry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner, apparently un-der the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost.
Harry tried every variation of "I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you" that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point: The room simply did not want to open for him. Frus-trated and annoyed, he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went. 
  
"Late again, Potter," said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom. "Ten points from Gryfrindor." Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron. Half the class were still on their feet, taking out books and orga-nizing their things; he could not be much later than any of them. 
  
"Before we start, I want your dementor essays," said Snape, wav-ing his wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. "And I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your books to page  what is it, Mr. Finnigan?" 
  
"Sir," said Seamus, "I've been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius " 
  
"No, there wasn't," said Snape in a bored voice. 
  
"But sir, I heard people talking " 
  
"If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher." 
  
"I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side," mut-tered Harry to Ron and Hermione. "Shouldn't he be upset Mun-dungus has been arrest " 
  
"But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject," said Snape, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Harry. "Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost." 
  
The whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn. "Er  well  ghosts are transparent " he said. 
  
"Oh, very good," interrupted Snape, his lip curling. "Yes, it in easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. 'Ghosts are transparent."' 
  
Pansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several other peo-ple were smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly, though his insides were boiling, "Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, aren't they? So they'd be solid " 
  
"A five-year-old could have told us as much," sneered Snape. "The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wiz-ard's spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard's bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth, and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent. " 
  
"Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we're trying to tell them apart!" said Ron. "When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we're going to be having a look to see if its solid, aren't we, we're not going to be asking, 'Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?'" There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the class. 
  
"Another ten points from Gryffindor," said Snape. "I would ex-pect nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room." 
  
"No!" whispered Hermione, grabbing Harrys arm as he opened his mouth furiously. "There's no point, you'll just end up in deten-tion again, leave it!"
"Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen," said Snape, smirking a little, "and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse."
  
Ron was very subdued all through the class. When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she ap-proached) and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ron's Appari-tion, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys' bathroom with Harry. 
  
"Snape's right, though, isn't he?" said Ron, after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two. "I dunno whether it's worth me taking the test. I just can't get the hang of Apparition." 
  
"You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you," said Harry reasonably. "It'll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if you're still not  you know  as good as you'd like to be, you can postpone the test, do it with me over the summer  Myrtle, this is the boys' bathroom!" 
  
The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair, staring at them through thick, white, round glasses. "Oh," she said glumly. "It's you two." 
  
"Who were you expecting?" said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.
  
"Nobody," said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on her chin. "He said he'd come back and see me, but then you said you'd pop in and visit me too"  she gave Harry a reproachful look  "and I haven't seen you for months and months. I've learned not to ex-pect too much from boys." 
  
"I thought you lived in that girls' bathroom?" said Harry, who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now. 
  
"I do," she said, with a sulky little shrug, "but that doesn't mean I cant visit other places. I came and saw you in your bath once, remember?" 
  
"Vividly," said Harry.
  
"But I thought he liked me," she said plaintively. "Maybe if you two left, he'd come back again. We had lots in common. I'm sure he felt it."
  
And she looked hopefully toward the door. "When you say you had lots in common," said Ron, sounding rather amused now, "d'you mean he lives in an S-bend too?" 
  
"No," said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom. "I mean he's sensitive, people bully him too, and he feels lonely and hasn't got anybody to talk to, and he's not afraid to show his feelings and cry!" 
  
"There's been a boy in here crying?" said Harry curiously. "A young boy?"
  
"Never you mind!" said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron, who was now definitely grinning. "I promised I wouldn't tell anyone, and I'll take his secret to the " 
  
" not the grave, surely?" said Ron with a snort. "The sewers, maybe." Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet, caus-ing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor. Goading Myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron. "You're right," he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder, "I'll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I de-cide about taking the test."
  
And so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement. 
  
"You'd do better," said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, "to go straight to Slughorn's of-fice and try and get that memory from him." 
  
"I've been trying!" said Harry crossly, which was perfectly true. He had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an at-tempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch him. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone. 
  
"He doesn't want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I've been trying to get him on his own again, and he's not going to let it happen! 
  
"Well, you've just got to keep at it, haven't you?"
  
The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was do-ing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker. He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, determined, whatever Her-mione said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement. 
  
Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Ma-rauder's Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good," and scanned it carefully. 
  
As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor. There were a few people out in the grounds, and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor, when he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very same little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He waited until he was right be-hind her before bending very low and whispering, "Helloyou're very pretty, aren't you?" 
  
Goyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corri-dor. Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance. It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried.
  
Yet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, hav-ing tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond belief-=Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing his patience completely, Harry ran at the wall and kicked it.
  
"OUCH!"
  
He thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.
  
"Harry?"
  
He spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his utter astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor. 
  
"Whatre you doing here?" he said, scrambling to his feet again; why did she always have to find him lying on the floor? 
  
"I came to see Dumbledore," said Tonks. Harry thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual, her mouse-colored hair lank. 
  
"His office isn't here," said Harry, "it's round the other side of the castle, behind the gargoyle "
  
"I know," said Tonks. "He's not there. Apparently he's gone away again."
  
"Has he?" said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor. "Hey  you don't know where he goes, I suppose?" 
  
"No," said Tonks.
  
"What did you want to see him about?"
  
"Nothing in particular," said Tonks, picking, apparently uncon-sciously, at the sleeve of her robe. "I just thought he might know what's going on. I've heard rumors people getting hurt." 
  
"Yeah, I know, it's all been in the papers," said Harry. "That lit-tle kid trying to kill his " 
  
"The Prophet's often behind the times," said Tonks, who didn't seem to be listening to him. "You haven't had any letters from any-one in the Order recently?" 
  
"No one from the Order writes to me anymore," said Harry, "not since Sirius  He saw that her eyes had filled with tears. 
  
"I'm sorry," he muttered awkwardly. "I mean... I miss him, as well." 
  
"What?" said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him. "Well. I'll see you around, Harry. 
  
And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving Harry to stare after her. After a minute or so, he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that Ron and Hermione would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to Malfoy who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come.
  
He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, already halfway through an early lunch.
  
"I did it  well, kind of!" Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him. "I was supposed to be Apparating to out-side Madam Puddifoots Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near Scrivenshafts, but at least I moved!" 
  
"Good one," said Harry. "How'd you do, Hermione?" 
  
"Oh, she was perfect, obviously," said Ron, before Hermione could answer. "Perfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is  we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you should've heard Twycross going on about her  I'll be surprised if he doesn't pop the question soon " 
  
"And what about you?" asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. "Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time?" 
  
"Yep," said Harry. "And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!" 
  
"Tonks?" repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking surprised.
  
"Yeah, she said she'd come to visit Dumbledore." 
  
"If you ask me," said Ron once Harry had finished describing his conversation with Tonks, "she's cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry."
  
"Its a bit odd," said Hermione, who for some reason looked very concerned. "She's supposed to be guarding the school, why she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he's not even here?" 
  
"I had a thought," said Harry tentatively. He felt strange about voicing it; this was much more Hermiones territory than his. "You don't think she can have been... you know... in love with Sirius?" 
  
Hermione stared at him. "What on earth makes you say that?" 
  
"I dunno," said Harry, shrugging, "but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name, and her Patronus is a big four-legged thing now. I wondered whether it hadn't become... you know... him." 
  
"It's a thought," said Hermione slowly. "But I still don't know why she'd be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if that's re-ally why she was here." 
  
"Goes back to what I said, doesn't it?" said Ron, who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth. "She's gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women," he said wisely to Harry, "they're easily upset." 
  
"And yet," said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, "I doubt you'd find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didn't laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus mimbletonia." 
  
Ron scowled.

Chapter 22: After the Burial
Patches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the castle turrets, but these signs of approaching summer did not lift Harry's mood. He had been thwarted, both in his attempts to find out what Malfoy was doing, and in his efforts to start a conversation with Slughorn that might lead, somehow, to Slughorn hand-ing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decades. 
  
"For the last time, just forget about Malfoy," Hermione told Harry firmly. 
  
They were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard after lunch. Hermione and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet  Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them  for they were taking their tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves. 
Ron gave a start and tried to hide behind Hermione as a girl came around the corner. 
  
"It isn't Lavender," said Hermione wearily. 
  
"Oh, good," said Ron, relaxing. 
  
"Harry Potter?" said the girl. "I was asked to give you this." 
"Thanks..." 
Harry's heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment. Once the girl was out of earshot he said, "Dumbledore said we wouldn't be having any more lessons until I got the memory!" 
  
"Maybe he wants to check on how you're doing?" suggested Hermione, as Harry unrolled the parchment; but rather than finding Dumbledore's long, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy sprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink had run. 
  
Dear Harry, Ron and Hermione! 
Aragog died last night. Harry and Ron, you met him and you know how special he was. 
Hermione, I know you'd have liked him. 
It would mean a lot to me if you'd nip down for the burial later this evening. 
I'm planning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite time of day. 
I know you're not supposed to be out that late, but you can use the cloak. 
Wouldn't ask, but I can't face it alone. 
Hagrid 
  
"Look at this," said Harry, handing the note to Hermione. "Oh, for heaven's sake," she said, scanning it quickly and passing it to Ron, who read it through looking increasingly incredulous. "He's mental" he said furiously. "That thing told its mates to eat Harry and me! Told them to help themselves! And now Hagrid ex-pects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body!" 
  
"Its not just that," said Hermione. "He's asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows security's a million times tighter and how much trouble we'd be in if we were caught." 
  
"We've been down to see him by night before," said Harry. 
  
"Yes, but for something like this?" said Hermione. "We've risked a lot to help Hagrid out, but after all  Aragog's dead. If it were a question of saving him " 
  
" I'd want to go even less," said Ron firmly. "You didn't meet him, Hermione. Believe me, being dead will have improved him a lot." 
  
Harry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotches all over it. Tears had clearly fallen thick and fast upon the parchment. . . . 
  
"Harry, you can't be thinking of going," said Hermione. "It's such a pointless thing to get detention for." 
  
Harry sighed. "Yeah, I know," he said. "I s'pose Hagrid'll have to bury Aragog without us." 
  
"Yes, he will," said Hermione, looking relieved. "Look, Potions will be almost empty this afternoon, with us all off doing our tests. . . . Try and soften Slughorn up a bit then!" 
  
"Fifty-seventh time lucky, you think?" said Harry bitterly. 
  
"Lucky," said Ron suddenly. "Harry, that's it  get lucky!" 
  
"What d'you mean?" 
  
"Use your lucky potion!" 
  
"Ron, that's  that's it!" said Hermione, sounding stunned. "Of course! Why didn't I think of it?" 
  
Harry stared at them both. "Felix Felicis?" he said. "I dunno . . . I was sort of saving it. ..." 
  
"What for?" demanded Ron incredulously. 
  
"What on earth is more important than this memory, Harry?" asked Hermione. 
  
Harry did not answer. The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for some time; vague and unformulated plans that involved Ginny splitting up with Dean, and Ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of his brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking. . . . 
  
"Harry? Are you still with us?" asked Hermione. 
  
"Wha  ? Yeah, of course," he said, pulling himself together. "Well. . . okay. If I can't get Slughorn to talk this afternoon, I'll take some Felix and have another go this evening." 
  
"That's decided, then," said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette. "Destination . . . determina-tion . . . deliberation . . ." she murmured. 
  
"Oh, stop that," Ron begged her, "I feel sick enough as it is  quick, hide me!" 
  
"It isn't Lavender!" said Hermione impatiently, as another cou-ple of girls appeared in the courtyard and Ron dived behind her. 
  
"Cool," said Ron, peering over Hermiones shoulder to check. "Blimey, they don't look happy, do they?" 
  
"They're the Montgomery sisters and of course they don't look happy, didn't you hear what happened to their little brother?" said Hermione. 
  
"I'm losing track of what's happening to everyone's relatives, to be honest," said Ron. 
  
"Well, their brother was attacked by a werewolf. The rumor is that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters. Anyway, the boy was only five and he died in St. Mungos, they couldn't save him." 
  
"He died?" repeated Harry, shocked. "But surely werewolves don't kill, they just turn you into one of them?" 
  
"They sometimes kill," said Ron, who looked unusually grave now. "I've heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away." 
  
"What was the werewolf's name?" said Harry quickly. 
  
"Well, the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback," said Hermione. 
  
"I knew it  the maniac who likes attacking kids, the one Lupin told me about!" said Harry angrily. 
  
Hermione looked at him bleakly. 
  
"Harry, you've got to get that memory," she said. "It's all about stopping Voldemort, isn't it? These dreadful things that are hap-pening are all down to him. . . ." 
  
The bell rang overhead in the castle and both Hermione and Ron jumped to their feet, looking terrified. 
  
"You'll do fine," Harry told them both, as they headed toward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Ap-parition Test. "Good luck." 
  
"And you too!" said Hermione with a significant look, as Harry headed off to the dungeons. 
  
There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: Harry, Ernie, and Draco Malfoy. 
  
"All too young to Apparate just yet?" said Slughorh genially, "Not turned seventeen yet?" 
  
They shook their heads. 
  
"Ah well," said Slughorn cheerily, "as we're so few, we'll do something for fun. I want you all to brew me up something amusing!" 
  
"That sounds good, sir," said Ernie sycophantically, rubbing his hands together. Malfoy, on the other hand, did not crack a smile. "What do you mean, 'something amusing'?" he said irritably. "Oh, surprise me," said Slughorn airily. 
  
Malfoy opened his copy of Advanced Potion-Making with a sulky expression. It could not have been plainer that he thought this les-son was a waste of time. Undoubtedly, Harry thought, watching him over the top of his own book, Malfoy was begrudging the time he could otherwise be spending in the Room of Requirement. 
  
Was it his imagination, or did Malfoy, like Tonks, look thinner! Certainly he looked paler; his skin still had that grayish tinge, probably because he so rarely saw daylight these days. But there was no air of smugness, excitement, or superiority; none of the swagger that he had had on the Hogwarts Express, when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by Voldemort. . . . There could be only one conclusion, in Harry's opinion: The mission, whatever it was, was going badly. 
  
Cheered by this thought, Harry skimmed through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making and found a heavily corrected Half-Blood Prince's version of "An Elixir to Induce Euphoria," which seemed not only to meet Slughorn's instructions, but which might (Harry's heart leapt as the thought struck him) put Slughorn into such a good mood that he would be prepared to hand over that memory if Harry could persuade him to taste some. . . . 
  
"Well, now, this looks absolutely wonderful," said Slughorn an hour and a half later, clapping his hands together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of Harry's cauldron. "Euphoria, I take it? And what's that I smell? Mmmm . . . you've added just a sprig of peppermint, haven't you? Unorthodox, but what a stroke of inspiration, Harry, of course, that would tend to counterbalance the occa-sional side effects of excessive singing and nose-tweaking. ... I really don't know where you get these brain waves, my boy . . . unless " 
  
Harry pushed the Half-Blood Prince's book deeper into his bag with his foot. 
  
" it's just your mother's genes coming out in you!" 
  
"Oh . . . yeah, maybe," said Harry, relieved. 
  
Ernie was looking rather grumpy; determined to outshine Harry for once, he had most rashly invented his own potion, which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron. Malfoy was already packing up, sour-faced; Slughorn had pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely "passable." 
..;. 
The bell rang and both Ernie and Malfoy left at once. "Sir," Harry began, but Slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder; when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and Harry, he hurried away as fast as he could. 
  
"Professor  Professor, don't you want to taste my po  ?" called Harry desperately. 
  
But Slughorn had gone. Disappointed, Harry emptied the caul-dron, packed up his things, left the dungeon, and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room. 
  
Ron and Hermione returned in the late afternoon. 
  
"Harry!" cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole. "Harry, I passed!" 
- 
"Well done!" he said. "And Ron?" 
  
"He  he just failed," whispered Hermione, as Ron came slouching into the room looking most morose. "It was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the examiner just spotted that he'd left half an eyebrow behind. . . How did it go with Slughorn?" 
  
"No joy," said Harry, as Ron joined them. "Bad luck, mate, but you'll pass next time  we can take it together." 
  
"Yeah, I s'pose," said Ron grumpily. "But half an eyebrow C like that matters!" 
  
"I know," said Hermione soothingly, "it does seem really harsh. ..." 
  
They spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the Apparition examiner, and Ron looked fractionally more cheerful by the time they set off back to the common room, now discussing the continuing problem of Slughorn and the memory. 
  
"So, Harry  you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?" Ron demanded. 
  
"Yeah, I s'pose I'd better," said Harry. "I don't reckon I'll need all of it, not twenty-four hours' worth, it can't take all night.... I'll just take a mouthful. Two or three hours should do it." 
  
"It's a great feeling when you take it," said Ron reminiscently. "Like you can't do anything wrong." 
  
"What are you talking about?" said Hermione, laughing. "You've never taken any!" 
  
"Yeah, but I thought I had, didn't I?" said Ron, as though ex-plaining the obvious. "Same difference really ..." 
  
As they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals, they lingered for a while in the common room, the plan being that Harry should go to Slughorn s office once the teacher had had time to get back there. When the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the Forbid-den Forest, they decided the moment had come, and after check-ing carefully that Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all in the common room, sneaked up to the boys' dormitory. 
  
Harry took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle. 
  
"Well, here goes," said Harry, and he raised the little bottle and look a carefully measured gulp. 
  
"What does it feel like?" whispered Hermione. 
  
Harry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all... and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only pos-sible, but positively easy. . . . 
  
He got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence. 
"Excellent," he said. "Really excellent. Right. . . I'm going down to Hagrid's." 
  
"What?" said Ron and Hermione together, looking aghast. 
  
"No, Harry  you've got to go and see Slughorn, remember?" said Hermione. 
  
"No," said Harry confidently. "I'm going to Hagrid's, I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's." 
  
"You've got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?" asked Ron, looking stunned. 
  
"Yeah," said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. "I feel like it's the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?" 
  
"No," said Ron and Hermione together, both looking positively alarmed now. 
  
"This is Felix Felicis, I suppose?" said Hermione anxiously, holding up the bottle to the light. "You haven't got another little bottle full of I don't know " 
  
"Essence of Insanity?" suggested Ron, as Harry swung his cloak over his shoulders. 
  
Harry laughed, and Ron and Hermione looked even more alarmed. 
  
"Trust me," he said. "I know what I'm doing ... or at least" he strolled confidently to the door "Felix does." 
  
He pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, Ron and Hermione hurrying along behind him. At the foot of the stairs, Harry slid through the open door. 
  
"What were you doing up there with her! shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys' dormitories. Harry heard Ron splutter-ing behind him as he darted across the room away from them. 
  
Getting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, Ginny and Dean came through it, and Harry was able to slip between them. As he did so, he brushed accidentally against Ginny. 
  
"Don't push me, please, Dean," she said, sounding annoyed. ; "You're always doing that, I can get through perfectly well on my own. ..." 
  
The portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not before he had heard Dean make an angry retort.. . . His feeling of elation in-creasing, Harry strode off through the castle. He did not have to creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest. This evening, he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts. 
  
Why he knew that going to Hagrid's was the right thing to do, he had no idea. It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time. He could not see the final destination, he could not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory. When he reached the en-trance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door. Beaming, Harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk. 
  
It was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to Hagrid's. It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to Harry that this was a whim on which he should act, so he di-rected his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where he was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout. Harry lurked be-hind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and listening to their conversation. 
  
"I do thank you for taking the time, Pomona," Slughorn was saying courteously, "most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight." 
  
"Oh, I quite agree," said Professor Sprout warmly. "That enough for you?" 
  
"Plenty, plenty," said Slughorn, who, Harry saw, was carrying an armful of leafy plants. "This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years, and some to spare if anybody over-stews them. . . . Well, good evening to you, and many thanks again!" 
  
Professor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses, and Slughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry stood, invisible. 
: 
Seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pullet I off the cloak with a flourish. 
  
"Good evening, Professor." 
  
"Merlins beard, Harry, you made me jump," said Slughotn, stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary. "How did you get out of the castle?" 
  
"I think Filch must've forgotten to lock the doors," said Harry cheerfully, and was delighted to see Slughorn scowl. 
  
"I'll be reporting that man, he's more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me. . . . But why are you out then, Harry?" 
  
"Well, sir, it's Hagrid," said Harry, who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth. "He's pretty upset. . . But you won't tell anyone, Professor? I don't want trouble for him. ..." 
  
Slughorn's curiosity was evidently aroused. "Well, I can't promise that," he said gruffly. "But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so I'm sure he can't be up to anything very dreadful. .. 
." 
"Well, it's this giant spider, he's had it for years. ... It lived in the forest. ... It could talk and everything " 
  
"I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest," said Slughorn softly, looking over at the mass of black trees. "It's true, then?" 
  
"Yes," said Harry. "But this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it died last night. He's devastated. He wants company while he buries it and I said I'd go." 
  
"Touching, touching," said Slughorn absentmindedly, his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of Hagrid's cabin. "But acromantula venom is very valuable ... If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out. . . . Of course, I wouldn't want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset. . . but if there was any way to procure some ... I mean, its almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while its alive. ..." 
  
Slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now. ". . . seems an awful waste not to collect it... might get a hun-dred Galleons a pint. ... To be frank, my salary is not large. . . ." 
  
And now Harry saw clearly what was to be done. "Well," he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, "well, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really pleased. . . . Give Aragog a better send-off, you know ..." 
  
"Yes, of course," said Slughorn, his eyes now gleaming with en-thusiasm. "I tell you what, Harry, I'll meet you down there with a bottle or two. . . . We'll drink the poor beast's  well  not health  but we'll send it off in style, anyway, once it's buried. And I'll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the occa-sion. . . ." 
  
He bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to Hagrid's, delighted with himself. 
  
"Yen came," croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him. 
  
"Yeah  Ron and Hermione couldn't, though," said Harry. "They're really sorry." 
  
"Don  don matter . . . Hed've bin touched yeh're here, though, Harry. . . ." 
  
Hagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish, and his eyes were puffy, red, and swollen. Harry patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach. 
  
"Where are we burying him?" he asked. "The forest?" 
  
"Blimey, no," said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bot-tom of his shirt. "The other spiders won' let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog's gone. Turns out it was only on his orders they didn' eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry?" 
  
The honest answer was "yes"; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the aero-mantulas. They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid. 
  
"Never bin an area o' the forest I couldn' go before!" said Hagrid, shaking his head. "It wasn' easy, gettin' Aragog's body out o' there, I can tell yeh  they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give 'im a nice burial... a proper send-off. . ." 
  
He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow, saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do), "Professor Slughorn met me coming down here, Hagrid." 
  
"Not in trouble, are yeh?" said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. "Yeh shouldn be outta the castle in the evenin', I know it, it's my fault " 
  
"No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he'd like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too," said Harry. 
  
"He's gone to change into something more suitable, I thinkand he said he'd bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog's mem-ory... 
  
"Did he?" said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. "Tha's  tha's righ' nice of him, that is, an' not turnin' yeh in ei-ther. I've never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. .. . Comin' ter see old Aragog off, though, eh? Well. . . hed've liked that, Aragog would. . . ." 
: 
Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he pro-vided, but he merely moved to the rear window of Hagrid's hut, where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs curled and tangled. 
  
"Are we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?" 
  
"Jus' beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought," said Hagrid in a choked voice. "I've already dug the  yeh know  grave. Jus' thought we'd say a few nice things over him  happy memories, yeh know " 
  
His voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door, and he turned to answer it, blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so. Slughorn hurried over the threshold, several bottles in his arms, and wearing a somber black cravat. 
  
"Hagrid," he said, in a deep, grave voice. "So very sorry to hear of your loss." 
  
"Tha's very nice of yeh," said Hagrid. "Thanks a lot. An' thanks fer not givin Harry detention neither. . . ." 
  
"Wouldn't have dreamed of it," said Slughorn. "Sad night, sad night. . . Where is the poor creature?" 
  
"Out here," said Hagrid in a shaking voice. "Shall we  shall we do it, then?" 
  
The three of them stepped out into the back garden. The moon was glistening palely through the trees now, and its rays mingled with the light spilling from Hagrid's window to illuminate Aragogs body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a ten-foot- high mound of freshly dug earth. 
  
"Magnificent," said Slughorn, approaching the spiders head, where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone, motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thougln he heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy head. 
  
"Its not ev'ryone appreciates how beau'iful they are said H grid to Slughorn's back, tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes. "I didn' know yeh were interested in creatures like Aragog, Horace." 
  
"Interested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them," said Slughorn, stepping back from the body. Harry saw the glint of a bottle disap-pear beneath his cloak, though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing. "Now . . . shall we proceed to the burial?" 
  
Hagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the gigantic spi-der into his arms and, with an enormous grunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the bottom with a rather horrible, crunchy thud. Hagrid started to cry again. 
  
"Of course, it's difficult for you, who knew him best," said Slughorn, who like Harry could reach no higher than Hagrid's el-bow, but patted it all the same. "Why don't I say a few words?" 
  
He must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog, Harry thought, for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, in a slow, impressive voice, "Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won't forget! Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your forest home. May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained." 
  
"Tha was . . . tha was . . . beau'iful!" howled Hagrid, and he collapsed onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever. 
  
"There, there," said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell, with a muffled sort of crash, onto the dead spider, forming a smooth mound. "Lets get inside and have a drink. Get on his other side, Harry. . . . That's it. ... Up you come, Hagrid . . . Well done ..." 
  
They deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table. Fang, who had been skulking in his basket during the burial, now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harry's lap as usual. Slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought. 
  
"I have had it all tested for poison," he assured Harry, pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagrid's bucket-sized mugs and handing it to Hagrid. "Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert." 
  
Harry saw, in his mind's eye, the expression on Hermione's face if she ever heard about this abuse of houseelves, and decided never to mention it to her. 
  
"One for Harry . . ." said Slughorn, dividing a second bottle be-tween two mugs, ". . . and one for me. Well"  he raised his mug high  "to Aragog." 
  
"Aragog," said Harry and Hagrid together. Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, however, with the way ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him. 
  
"I had him from an egg, yeh know," said Hagrid morosely. "'Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. 'Bout the size of a Pekingese 
  
"Sweet," said Slughorn. 
  
"Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until . . . well..." 
  
Hagrid's face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets. Slughorn, however, did not seem to be listening; he was looking up at the ceiling, from which a number of brass pots hung, and also a long, silky skein of bright white hair. 
  
"That's not unicorn hair, Hagrid?" 
  
"Oh, yeah," said Hagrid indifferently. "Gets pulled out of their tails, they catch it on branches an' stuff in the forest, yeh know ..." 
  
"But my dear chap, do you know how much that's worth?" 
  
"I use it fer bindin' on bandages an stuff if a creature gets in jured," said Hagrid, shrugging. "It's dead useful. . . very strong. 
  
Slughorn took another deep draught from his mug, his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now, looking, Harry knew, for more treasures that he might be able to convert into a plentiful su ply of oak-matured mead, crystalized pineapple, and velvet smok-ing jackets. He refilled Hagrid's mug and his own, and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how Hagrid was able to look after them all. Hagrid, becoming expan-sive under the influence of the drink and Slughorn's flattering in-terest, stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of bowtruckle husbandry. 
  
The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Re-filling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slug-liorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill. 
After an hour or so, Hagrid and Slughorn began making extravagant toasts: to Hogwarts, to Dumbledore, to elf-made wine, and to- 
  
"Harry Potter!" bellowed Hagrid, slopping some of his four-teenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it. 
  
"Yes, indeed," cried Slughorn a little thickly, "Parry Otter, the Chosen Boy Who  well  something of that sort," he mumbled, and drained his mug too. 
; 
Not long after this, Hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn, who pocketed it with cries of, "To friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair!" 
  
And for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side, arms around each other, singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo. 
  
"Aaargh, the good die young," muttered Hagrid, slumping low onto the table, a little cross-eyed, while Slughorn continued to war-ble the refrain. "Me dad was no age ter go ... nor were yer mum' an' dad, Harry . . ." 
  
Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of Hagrid's crinkled eyes again; he grasped Harry's arm and shook it 
  
"Bes' wiz and witchard o' their age  I never knew.. . terrible thing . . . terrible thing ..." 
  
And Odo the hero, they bore him back home 
To the place that he'd known as a lad, 
sang Slughorn plaintively. 
They laid him to rest with his hat inside out. 
And his wand snapped in two, which was sad. 
  
". . . terrible," Hagrid grunted, and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep, snoring deeply. 
  
"Sorry," said Slughorn with a hiccup. "Can't carry a tune to save my life." 
  
"Hagrid wasn't talking about your singing," said Harry quietly. "He was talking about my mum and dad dying." 
  
"Oh," said Slughorn, repressing a large belch. "Oh dear. Yes, that was  was terrible indeed. Terrible . . . terrible ..." 
  
He looked quite at a loss for what to say, and resorted to refilling their mugs. 
  
"I don't  don't suppose you remember it, Harry?" he asked awkwardly. 
  
"No  well, I was only one when they died," said Harry, his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in Hagrid's heavy snores. "But I've found out pretty much what happened since. My dad died first. Did you know that?" 
  
"I  I didn't," said Slughorn in a hushed voice. 
  
"Yeah . . . Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum," said Harry. 
  
Slughorn gave a great shudder, but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from Harry's face. 
  
"He told her to get out of the way," said Harry remorselessly. "He told me she needn't have died. He only wanted me. She could have run." 
  
"Oh dear," breathed Slughorn. "She could have . . . she needn't . . . That's awful. . . ." 
  
"It is, isn't it?" said Harry, in a voice barely more than a whisper. "But she didn't move. Dad was already dead, but she didn't want me to go too. She tried to plead with Voldemort. . . but he just laughed...." 
  
"That's enough!" said Slughorn suddenly, raising a shaking hand. "Really, my dear boy, enough . . . I'm an old man ... I don't need to hear ... I don't want to hear ..." 
  
"I forgot," lied Harry, Felix Felicis leading him on. "You liked her, didn't you?" 
  
"Liked her?" said Slughorn, his eyes brimming with tears once more. "I don't imagine anyone who met her wouldn't have liked her. . . . Very brave . . . Very funny... It was the most horrible thing. ..." 
  
"But you won't help her son," said Harry. "She gave me her life, but you won't give me a memory." 
  
Hagrid's rumbling snores filled the cabin. Harry looked steadily into Slughorn's tear-filled eyes. The Potions master seemed unable to look away. 
  
"Don't say that," he whispered. "It isn't a question ... If it were to help you, of course . . . but no purpose can be served . . ." 
"It can," said Harry clearly. "Dumbledore needs information. I need information." 
  
He knew he was safe: Felix was telling him that Slughorn would remember nothing of this in the morning. Looking Slughorn straight in the eye, Harry leaned forward a little. 
  
"I am the Chosen One. I have to kill him. I need that memory." 
  
Slughorn turned paler than ever; his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat. 
  
"You are the Chosen One?" . . I. 
  
"Of course I am," said Harry calmly. 
  
"But then . . . my dear boy . . . you're asking a great deal. . . you're asking me, in fact, to aid you in your attempt to destroy- 
  
"You don't want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans?'" 
  
"Harry, Harry, of course I do, but " 
  
"You're scared he'll find out you helped me?" 
  
Slughorn said nothing; he looked terrified. 
  
"Be brave like my mother, Professor. . . ." 
  
Slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth; he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby. 
  
"I am not proud . . ." he whispered through his fingers. "I am ashamed of what  of what that memory shows. ... I think I may have done great damage that day. ..." 
  
"You'd cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory," said Harry. "It would be a very brave and noble thing to do." 
  
Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on. Slughorn and Harry stared at each other over the guttering candle. There was a long, long silence, but Felix Felicis told Harry not to break it, to wait. Then, very slowly, Slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand. He put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small, empty bottle. Still looking into Harry's eyes, Slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it, so that a long, silver thread of memory came away too, clinging to the wand tip. Longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung, silvery bright, from the wand. Slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled, then spread, swirling like gas. He corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to Harry. 
  
"Thank you very much, Professor." 
  
"You're a good boy," said Professor Slughorn, tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus mustache. "And you've got her eyes. . . . Just don't think too badly of me once you've seen it. . . ," 
  
And he too put his head on his arms, gave a deep sigh, and fell asleep. 

Chapter 23: Horcruxes
Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he creeped back into the castle. The front door had remained un locked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood. 
  
"What sort of time do you call this?" 
  
"I'm really sorry  I had to go out for something important " 
  
"Well, the password changed at midnight, so you'll just have to sleep in the corridor, won't you?" 
  
"You're joking!" said Harry. "Why did it have to change at midnight?" 
  
"That's the way it is," said the Fat Lady. "If you're angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he's the one who's tightened security." 
  
"Fantastic," said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. "Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he's the one who wanted me to " 
  
"He is here," said a voice behind Harry. "Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago." 
Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wob-bling as usual upon his ruff. 
"I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive," said Nick. "He appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course." 
"Where is he?" said Harry, his heart leaping, 
  
"Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it's a, favorite pastime of his " 
  
"Not the Bloody Baron  Dumbledore!" 
  
"Oh  in his office," said Nick. "I believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in " 
  
"Yeah, he has," said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him. 
  
"Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The password's still 'tapeworm'!" 
  
But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying "toffee eclairs" to Dumbledore's gar-goyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase. 
  
"Enter," said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted. Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore's office, looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond the windows. 
"Good gracious, Harry," said Dumbledore in surprise. "To what do I owe this very late pleasure?" 
  
"Sir  I've got it. Ive got the memory from Slughorn." 
  
Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile. 
  
"Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!" 
  
All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughorn's memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kepi the Pensieve. 
"And now," said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon the desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. "Now, at last. we shall see. Harry, quickly . . ." 
  
Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn's office many years before. There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystallized pineapple. And there were the half dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvolo's gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger. 
  
Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, "Sir is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?" 
  
"Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn't tell you," said Slughorn, wag-ging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. "I must say, I'd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are." 
  
Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. 
  
"What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn't, and your careful flattery of the people who matter  thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you're quite right, it is my favorite " Several of the boys tittered again. " I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have ex-cellent contacts at the Ministry." 
  
Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader. 
  
"I don't know that politics would suit me, sir," he said when the laughter had died away. "I don't have the right kind of background, for one thing." 
  
A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader's famous ancestor. 
  
"Nonsense," said Slughorn briskly, "couldn't be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you'll go far, Tom, I've never been wrong about a student yet." 
  
The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn's desk chimed eleven o'clock behind him and he looked around. 
  
"Good gracious, is it that time already? You'd better get going boys, or we'll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by in morrow or it's detention. Same goes for you, Avery." 
  
One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there. 
"Look shar 
p, Tom, you don't want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect.. ." 
  
"Sir, I wanted to ask you something." -' "Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away. . . ." 
  
"Sir, I wondered what you know about. . . about Horcruxes?' 
  
Slughorn stared at him, his thick ringers absentmindedly clawing the stem of his wine glass. 
"Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?" 
  
But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork. 
  
"Not exactly, sir," said Riddle. "I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it." 
"No . . . well. . . you'd be hard-pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that'll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed," said Slughorn. 
  
"But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you  sorry, I mean, if you can't tell me, obviously  I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could  so I just thought I'd C 
  
It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of re-luctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks. 
  
"Well," said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystallized pineapple, "well, it can't hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand t he term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a per-son has concealed part of their soul." 
  
"I don't quite understand how that works, though, sir," said Riddle. 
  
His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement. 
"Well, you split your soul, you see," said Slughorn, "and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one's body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form ..." 
  
Slughorn's face crumpled and Harry found himself remember-ing words he had heard nearly two years before: "I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive." 
"... few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable." 
  
But Riddle's hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing. 
  
"How do you split your soul?" 
  
"Well," said Slughorn uncomfortably, "you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting n it I an act of violation, it is against nature." 
"But how do you do it?" 
  
"By an act of evil  the supreme act of evil. By commiting murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion " 
  
"Encase? But how  ?" 
  
"There is a spell, do not ask me, I don't know!" said Slughoin shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. " Do I look as though I have tried it  do I look like a killer?" 
  
"No, sir, of course not," said Riddle quickly. "I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to offend . . ." 
  
"Not at all, not at all, not offended," said Slughorn gruffly, "It is natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . ." 
  
"Yes, sir," said Riddle. "What I don't understand, though  just out of curiosity  I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn't seven  ?" 
  
"Merlin's beard, Tom!" yelped Slughorn. "Seven! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . ." 
  
Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all. 
  
"Of course," he muttered, "this is all hypothetical, what we're discussing, isn't it? All academic . . ." 
  
"Yes, sir, of course," said Riddle quickly. 
  
"But all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I've told  that's to say, what we've discussed. People wouldn't like to think we've been chatting about Horcruxes. It's a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledore's particularly fierce about it. ..." 
  
"I won't say a word, sir," said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild hap-piness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wiz-ard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . . 
  
"Thank you, Harry," said Dumbledore quietly. "Let us go. . . ." 
  
When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was ; already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak. 
  
"I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time," said Dumbledore at last. "It confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. ..." 
  
Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old head-masters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet. 
  
"Well, Harry," said Dumbledore, "I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal." 
  
"You think he succeeded then, sir?" asked Harry. "He made a Horcrux? And that's why he didn't die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?" 
  
"A bit... or more," said Dumbledore. "You heard Voldemort, what he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxc. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know  as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew  no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two." 
  
Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thought, and then said, "Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul." 
  
"Where?" asked Harry. "How?" 
  
"You handed it to me, Harry," said Dumbledore. "The diary, Riddles diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets." 
  
"I don't understand, sir," said Harry. 
  
"Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the di-ary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never wit-nessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. ... a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard." 
  
"1 still don't understand," said Harry. 
  
"Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work  in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess some-body else, so that Slytherin's monster would be unleashed again." 
  
"Well, he didn't want his hard work to be wasted," said Harry. "He wanted people to know he was Slytherin's heir, because he couldn't take credit at the time." 
  
"Quite correct," said Dumbledore, nodding. "But don't you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else's path and run the risk that they might destroy it  as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that. 
The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made  or had been planning to make  more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to be-lieve it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Volde-mort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarm-ing statement to his Death Eaters. I who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. That was what you told me he said. 'Further than anybody!' And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I dont believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldomort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explainable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call 'usual evil' . . ." 
  
"So he's made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?" said Harry. "Why couldn't he make a Sorcerer's Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?" 
  
"Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago," s;n?l Dumbledore. "But there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer's Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort, 
"While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must lie drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain the immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependant on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes. He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already im-mortal, you see ... or as close to immortal as any man can be. But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the se-cret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: 'Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn't seven the most powerfully magical number . . .' Isn't seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort." 
  
"He made seven Horcruxes?" said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock mid outrage. "But they could be anywhere in the world  hidden  buried or invisible " 
  
"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem," said Dumbledore calmly. "But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Hor-cruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack  the piece that lives in his body." 
"But the six Horcruxes, then," said Harry, a little desperately, "how are we supposed to find them?" 
"You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another." 
  
"You have?" said Harry eagerly. 
  
"Yes indeed," said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. "The ring, Harry. Marvolo's ring. And a ter-rible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been  forgive me the lack of seemly modesty  for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape's timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, des-perately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a sev-enth of Voldemort's soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux." 
  
"But how did you find it?" 
"Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort's past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts house. It seem that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in side it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment. 
"However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain." 
"And they could be anything?" said Harry. "They could be oh, in tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . ." 
  
"You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things, suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxr with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor." 
  
"The diary wasn't that special." 
  
"The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Hire of Slytherin. I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stu-pendous importance." 
  
"So, the other Horcruxes?" said Harry. "Do you think you know what they are, sir?" 
  
"I can only guess," said Dumbledore. "For the reasons I have al-ready given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him." 
  
"The locket!" said Harry loudly, "Hufflepuff's cup!" 
  
"Yes," said Dumbledore, smiling, "I would be prepared to bet  perhaps not my other hand  but a couple of fingers, that they be-came Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort's imagination. I can-not answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw's. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe." 
  
Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case. 
  
"Do you think that's why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?" said Harry. "To try and find something from one of the other founders?" 
  
"My thoughts precisely," said Dumbledore. "But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders' objects. He definitely had two  he may have found three  that is the best we can do for now." 
  
"Even if he got something of Ravenclaw's or of Gryffindor's, that leaves a sixth Horcrux," said Harry, counting on his fingers. "Unless hes got both?" 
  
"I don't think so," said Dumbledore. "I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?' 
  
"The snake?" said Harry, startled. "You can use animals as Horcruxes?" 
  
"Well, it is inadvisable to do so," said Dumbledore, "because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the inten-tion of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invin-cible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemorts mys-tique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an un-usual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth." 
  
"So," said Harry, "the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw's or Gryffindor's?" 
  
"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes," said Dum-bledore, bowing his head. 
  
"So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you've been going when you've been leaving the school?" 
  
"Correct," said Dumbledore. "I have been looking for a very long time. I think. . . perhaps ... I may be close to finding an-other one. There are hopeful signs." 
  
"And if you do," said Harry quickly, "can I come with you and help get rid of it?" 
  
Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, "Yes, I think so." 
  
"I can?" said Harry, thoroughly taken aback. 
  
"Oh yes," said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. "I think you have earned that right." 
  
Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and head-mistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore's decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted. 
"Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?" Harry asked, ignoring the portraits. 
  
"A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold." 
  
"But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts?" 
  
"Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemorts say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort van-ished shortly after giving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Luciuss fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his mas-ters soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence  but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends. By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasleys daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incrim-inating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemorts fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be sur-prised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment." 
  
Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, "So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort couldbe killed?" 
"Yes, I think so," said Dumbledore. "Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged be-yond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes." 
  
"But I haven't got uncommon skill and power," said Harry, be-fore he could stop himself. 
  
"Yes, you have," said Dumbledore firmly. "You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can " 
"I know!" said Harry impatiently. "I can love!" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, "Big deal!" 
  
"Yes, Harry, you can love," said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. "Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry." 
  
"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means  love?" asked Harry, feeling a little let down. 
  
"Yes  just love," said Dumbledore. "But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him  and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dan-gerous to him!" 
  
"But it comes to the same " 
  
"No, it doesn't!" said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, "You are setting too much store by the prophecy!" 
  
"But," spluttered Harry, "but you said the prophecy means  
  
"If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Ho you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?" 
  
"But," said Harry, bewildered, "but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other " 
  
"Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney's words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into ac-tion, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!" 
  
"But " 
  
"It is essential that you understand this!" said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. "By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remark-able person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort's fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort's world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been se-duced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slight-est desire to become one of Voldemort's followers!" 
  
"Of course I haven't!" said Harry indignantly. "He killed my mum and dad!" 
  
"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!" said Dum-bledore loudly. "The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mir-ror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort's mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you with-out enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole." 
  
"But, sir," said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argu-mentative, "it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or " 
  
"Got to?" said Dumbledore. "Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, 
that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!" 
  
Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sinus. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. 
"I'd want him finished," said Harry quietly. "And I'd want to do it." 
  
"Of course you would!" cried Dumbledore. "You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. ... In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that " 
  
"That one of us is going to end up killing the other," said Harry. "Yes." 
  
But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumble-dore knew  and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents  that there was all the difference in the world. 

Chapter 24: Sectumsempra
Exhausted but delighted with his night's work, Harry told Ron and Hermione everything that had happened during next morning's Charms lesson (having first cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them). They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and positively awed when he told them about Voldemort's Horcruxes and Dumbledore's promise to take Harry along, should he find another one. 
"Wow," said Ron, when Harry had finally finished telling them everything; Ron was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing. "Wow. You're actually going to go with Dumbledore . . . and try and destroy . . . wow." 
"Ron, you're making it snow," said Hermione patiently, grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which, sure enough, large white flakes had started to fall. Lavender Brown, Harry noticed, glared at Hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes, and Hermione immediately let go of Rons arm. 
"Oh yeah," said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise. "Sorry... looks like we've all got horrible dandruff now. ..." 
He brushed some of the fake snow off Hermiones shoulder Lavender burst into tears. Ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her. 
"We split up," he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth, "Last night. When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione. Obviously she couldn't see you, so she thought it had just been the two of us." 
"Ah," said Harry. "Well  you don't mind it's over, do you?", "No," Ron admitted. "It was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didn't have to finish it." 
"Coward," said Hermione, though she looked amused. "Well, it was a bad night for romance all around. Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry." 
Harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him that, but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga. Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could, he asked, "How come?" 
"Oh, something really silly . . . She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole, like she couldn't climb in herself . . . but they've been a bit rocky for ages." 
Harry glanced over at Dean on the other side of the classroom. He certainly looked unhappy. 
"Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesn't it?" said Hermione. 
"What d'you mean?" said Harry quickly. 
"The Quidditch team," said Hermione. "If Ginnyand Dean aren't speaking . . ." 
"Oh  oh yeah," said Harry. 
"Flitwick," said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way toward them, and Hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of Harry's and Ron's were still murky brown. 
"Now, now, boys," squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully. "A little less talk, a little more action . . . Let me see you try. . . ." 
Together they raised their wands, concentrating with all their might, and pointed them at their flasks. Harry's vinegar turned to ice; Rons flask exploded. 
"Yes ... for homework," said Professor Flitwick, reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat, "practice." 
They had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and walked back to the common room together. Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and Hermione seemed cheery too, though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said, "It's a nice day." Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside Harry's brain: 
  
She's Rons sister. 
But she's ditched Dean! 
She's still Rons sister. 
I'm his best mate!
That'll make it worse. 
If I talked to him first  
He'd hit you.
What if I don't care?
He's your best mate!
  
Harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room, and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered together there, until Hermione cried, "Katie! You're back! Are you okay?" 
Harry stared: It was indeed Katie Bell, looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends. 
"I'm really well!" she said happily. "They let me out of St. Mungos on Monday, I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning. Leanne was just telling me about McLaggen and the last match, Harry. . . ." 
"Yeah," said Harry, "well, now you're back and Ron's fit, we'll have a decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw, which means we could still be in the running for the Cup. Listen, Katie . . ." 
He had to put the question to her at once; his curiosity even drove Ginny temporarily from his brain. He dropped his voice as Katie's friends started gathering up their things; apparently they were late for Transfiguration. 
". . . that necklace . . . can you remember who gave it to you now?" 
"No," said Katie, shaking her head ruefully. "Everyone's been asking me, but I haven't got a clue. The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies' in the Three Broomsticks." 
"You definitely went into the bathroom, then?" said Hermione. 
"Well, I know I pushed open the door," said Katie, "so I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it. After that, my memory's a blank until about two weeks ago in St. Mungo's. Listen, I'd better go, I wouldn't put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back. ..." 
She caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them. 
"So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace," said Hermione, "to be in the ladies' bathroom." 
"Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman," said Harry. "Don't forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hog-warts. We know some of it got stolen. . . ." 
In his mind's eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past, all transformed into girls. 
"I think I'm going to take another swig of Felix," said Harry, "and have a go at the Room of Requirement again." 
"That would be a complete waste of potion," said Hermione flatly, putting down the copy of Spellmans Syllabary she had just taken out of her bag. "Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn't enough to get you through a powerful enchantment, though. Don't go wasting the rest of that potion! You'll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him ..." She dropped her voice to a whisper. 
"Couldn't we make some more?" Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione. "It'd be great to have a stock of it. ... Have a look in the book... " 
Harry pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bap, and looked up Felix Felicis. 
"Blimey, its seriously complicated," he said, running an eye down the list of ingredients. "And it takes six months.,. You've got to let it stew. ..." 
"Typical," said Ron. 
Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectum-sempra spell, captioned "For Enemies," that he had marked a few weeks previously. He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares. 
The only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough when Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back. 
The following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well. 
Ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul of the team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; he had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch. 
The battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? Sometimes he thought that the post-Lavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but then he remembered Ron's expression when he had seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand. . . . 
Yet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own. It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties, for Ron would not be around  but unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for Hermione's help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn't do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good. 
All in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Hermione put it, "tweaking the circumstances"? The balmy days slid gently through May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry's shoulder every time he saw Ginny. Harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds. There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time and had little thought for anything else. 
Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was still wide open. If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never known his team to fly better) then they would win the Championship. If they won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries. 
The run-up to this crucial match had all the usual features: members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up. Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in Harry's mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after-match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis. 
In the midst of all his preoccupations, Harry had not forgotten his other ambition: finding out what Malfoy was up to in the Room of Requirement. He was still checking the Marauder's Map, and as he was unable to locate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room. Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly doorless. 
A few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room, Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than anything, Harry made his usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the Marauder's Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy's tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys' bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle. 
Harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor. The loud crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below. Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door. He could not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open. 
Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side of the sink, his white-blond head bowed. 
"Don't," crooned Moaning Myrtle's voice from one of the cubicles. "Don't. . . tell me what's wrong ... I can help you. . . ." 
"No one can help me," said Malfoy. His whole body was shaking. "I can't do it. ... I can't. ... It won't work . . . and unless 1 do it soon ... he says he'll kill me. ..." 
And Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot, that Malfoy was crying  actually crying  tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into flu-cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder. 
Malfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoy's hex missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways, thought Levicorpus! and flicked his wand, but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another  
"No! No! Stop it!" squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room. "Stop! STOP!" 
There was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded; Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that backfired off the wall be-hind Malfoy's ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myr-tle, who screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Harry slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, "Cruci " 
"SECTUMSEMPRA!" bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly. 
Blood spurted from Malfoy's face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword. He staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling from his limp right hand. 
"No " gasped Harry. 
Slipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and plunged toward Malfoy, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest. 
"No  I didn't " 
Harry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his knees beside Malfoy, who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood. Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream: "MURDER! MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!" 
The door banged open behind Harry and he looked up, terrified: Snape had burst into the room, his face livid. Pushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand, and traced it over the deep wounds Harry's curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy's face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting. 
Harry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water. Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead. When Snape had performed his countercurse for the third time, he half-lifted Malfoy into a standing position. 
"You need the hospital wing. There may be a certain amount of scarring, but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that.. . . Come...." 
He supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury, "And you, Potter . . . You wait here for me." 
It did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He stood up slowly, shaking, and looked down at the wet floor. There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface. He could not even find it in himself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet, as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment. 
Snape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him. 
"Go," he said to Myrtle, and she swooped back into her toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind her. 
"I didn't mean it to happen," said Harry at once. His voice echoed in the cold, watery space. "I didn't know what that spell did." 
But Snape ignored this. "Apparently I underestimated you, Potter," he said quietly. "Who would have thought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell?" 
"I  read about it somewhere." 
"Where?" 
"It was  a library book," Harry invented wildly. "I can't remember what it was call " 
"Liar," said Snape. Harry's throat went dry. He knew what Snape was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it. ... 
The bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes; he struggled to block out all thought, but try as he might, the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making swam hazily to the forefront of his mind. 
And then he was staring at Snape again, in the midst of this wrecked, soaked bathroom. He stared into Snape's black eyes, hoping against hope that Snape had not seen what he feared, but  
"Bring me your schoolbag," said Snape softly, "and all of your schoolbooks. All of them. Bring them to me here. Now!" 
There was no point arguing. Harry turned at once and splashed 
out of the bathroom. Once in the corridor, he broke into a run toward Gryffindor Tower. Most people were walking the other way; they gaped at him, drenched in water and blood, but he answered none of the questions fired at him as he ran past. 
He felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage; what had the Prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book? And what would happen when Snape saw it? Would he tell Slughorn  Harry's stomach churned  how Harry had been achieving such good results in Potions all year? Would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught Harry so much . . . the book that had become a kind of guide and friend? Harry could not let it happen. . . . He could not. . . 
"Where've you  ? Why are you soaking  ? Is that blood." Ron was standing at the top of the stairs, looking bewildered at , the sight of Harry. 
"I need your book," Harry panted. "Your Potions book. Quick . . . give it to me . . ." 
"But what about the Half-Blood " 
"I'll explain later!" 
Ron pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and handed it over; Harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room. Here, he seized his schoolbag, ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner, threw himself back out of the portrait hole, and hurtled off along the seventh-floor corridor. 
He skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls, closed his eyes, and began to walk. 
I need a place to hide my book. . . . I need a place to hide my book. . . . I need a place to hide my book. ... 
Three times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall. When he opened his eyes, there it was at last: the door to the Room of Requirement. Harry wrenched it open, flung him self inside, and slammed it shut. 
He gasped. Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom, he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at. He was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls, built of what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants. There were alleyways and roads bordered by tetering piles of broken and damaged furniture, stowed away, perhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or else hidden by castle-proud house-elves. There were thousands and thousands of books, no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen. There were winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees, some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden items; there were chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were what looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords, and a heavy, bloodstained axe. 
Harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure. He turned right past an enormous stuffed troll, ran on a short way, took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which Montague had got lost the previous year, finally pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface. He opened one of the cupboard's creaking doors: It had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since died; its skeleton had five legs. He stuffed the Half-Blood Princes book behind the cage and slammed the door. He paused for a moment, his heart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the clutter. . . . Would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statues head to make it more distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go, back to the door, back out onto the corridor, where he slammed the door behind him, and it turned at once back into stone. 
Harry ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor below, cramming Ron's copy of Advanced Potion-Making into his bag as he did so. A minute later, he was back in front of Snape, who held out his hand wordlessly for Harry's schoolbag. Harry handed it over, panting, a searing pain in his chest, and waited. 
One by one, Snape extracted Harrys books and examined them., Finally, the only book left was the Potions book, which he looked at very carefully before speaking. 
"This is your copy of Advanced Potion-Making, is it, Potter?" 
"Yes," said Harry, still breathing hard. 
"You're quite sure of that, are you, Potter?" 
"Yes," said Harry, with a touch more defiance. 
"This is the copy of Advanced Potion-Making that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts?" 
"Yes," said Harry firmly. 
"Then why," asked Snape, "does it have the name 'Roonil Wazlib' written inside the front cover?" 
Harrys heart missed a beat. "That's my nickname," he said. ' 
"Your nickname," repeated Snape. ; "Yeah . . . that's what my friends call me," said Harry. 
"I understand what a nickname is," said Snape. The cold, black eyes were boring once more into Harry's; he tried not to look into them. Close your mind. . . . Close your mind. . . . But he had never learned how to do it properly. . . . 
"Do you know what I think, Potter?" said Snape, very quietly. "I think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term. "What do you think, Potter?" 
"I  I don't agree, sir," said Harry, still refusing to look into Snape's eyes. 
"Well, we shall see how you feel after your detentions," said Snape. "Ten o'clock Saturday morning, Potter. My office." 
"But sir . . ." said Harry, looking up desperately. "Quidditch . . . the last match of the ..." 
"Ten o'clock," whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his yellow teeth. "Poor Gryffindor. . . fourth place this year, I fear ..." 
And he left the bathroom without another word, leaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than Ron had ever felt in his life. 
"I won't say 'I told you so,'" said Hermione, an hour later in the common room. 
"Leave it, Hermione," said Ron angrily. 
Harry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite at all. He had just finished telling Ron, Hermione, and Ginny what had happened, not that there seemed to have been much need. The news had traveled very fast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story; Malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no time in vilifying Harry far and wide, and Snape had told the staff precisely what had happened. Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor McGonagall, who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly Snape's punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term. 
"I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person," Hermione said, evidently unable to stop herself. "And I was right, wasn't I." 
"No, I don't think you were," said Harry stubbornly. 
He was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing him; the looks on the Gryffindor team's faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all. He could feel Ginny's eyes on him now but did not meet them; he did not want to see disappointment or anger there. He had just told her that she would be playing Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be rejoining the team as Chaser in her place. Perhaps, if they won, Ginny and Dean would make up during the post-match euphoria. . . . The thought went through Harry like an icy knife. . . . 
"Harry," said Hermione, "how can you still stick up for that book when that spell " 
"Will you stop harping on about the book!" snapped Harry. "The Prince only copied it out! It's not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him!" 
"I don't believe this," said Hermione. "You're actually defending 
"I'm not defending what I did!" said Harry quickly. "I wish 1 ; hadn't done it, and not just because I've got about a dozen detentions. You know I wouldn't've used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can't blame the Prince, he hadn't written 'try this out, it's really good'  he was just making notes for himself, wasn't he, not for anyone else. . . ." 
"Are you telling me," said Hermione, "that you're going to go back  ?" 
"And get the book? Yeah, I am," said Harry forcefully. "Listen, without the Prince I'd never have won the Felix Felicis. I'd never have known how to save Ron from poisoning, I'd never have " 
" got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don't deserve," said Hermione nastily. 
"Give it a rest, Hermione!" said Ginny, and Harry was so amazed, so grateful, he looked up. "By the sound of it, Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had something good up his sleeve!" 
"Well, of course I'm glad Harry wasn't cursed!" said Hermione, clearly stung. "But you can't call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where it's landed him! And I'd have thought, seeing what this has done to your chances in the match " 
"Oh, don't start acting as though you understand Quidditch," snapped Ginny, "you'll only embarrass yourself." 
Harry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had always got on together very well, were now sitting with their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. Ron looked nervously at Harry, then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it. Harry, however, 
little though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening. 
His lightheartedness was short-lived. There were Slytherin taunts to be endured next day, not to mention much anger from fellow Gryffindors, who were most unhappy that their Captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season. By Saturday morning, whatever he might have told Hermione, Harry would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the others. It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves, to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan. 
"Ah, Potter," said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls. Ominously, there were many cob-webbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard, and pointless work about them. 
"Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files," said Snape softly. "They are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes. You will not use magic." 
"Right, Professor," said Harry, with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables. 
"I thought you could start," said Snape, a malicious smile on his lips, "with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fifty-six. You will find some familiar names in there, which should add interest to the task. Here, you see . . ." 
He pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read, "James Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubreys head twice normal size. Double detention." Snape sneered. "It must be such a comforting thing that, though they are gone, a record of their great achievements remains." 
Harry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach. Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him. 
It was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Sirius's names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. And while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments, he wondered what was going on outside, where the match would have just started . . . Ginny playing Seeker against Cho . . . 
Harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall. It seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock; perhaps Snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly? He could not have been here for only half an hour ... an hour ... an hour and a half. . . . 
Harry's stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken at all since setting Harry his task, finally looked up at ten past one. 
"I think that will do," he said coldly. "Mark the place you have reached. You will continue at ten o'clock next Saturday." Yes, sir. 
Harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before Snape could change his mind, racing back up the stone steps, straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch, but all was quiet. ... It was over, then. . . . 
He hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase; whether Gryffindor had won or lost, the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room. 
"Quid agis?" he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, wondering what he would find inside. 
Her expression was unreadable as she replied, "You'll see." 
And she swung forward. 
A roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. Harry gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him; several hands pulled him into the room. 
"We won!" yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Harry. "We won! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won!" 
Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. 
After several long moments  or it might have been half an hour  or possibly several sunlit days  they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginny's head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry's eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, Wellif you must. 
The creature in his chest roaring in triumph, he grinned down at Ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole. A long walk in the grounds seemed indicated, during which  if they had time  they might discuss the match. 
  

Chapter 25: The Seer Overheard 


The fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks. After all, it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time, rather than because he had been involved in hor-rific scenes of Dark magic.
'You'd think people had better things to gossip about,' said Ginny, as she sat on the common-room floor, leaning against Harry's legs and reading the Daily Prophet. Three Dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it's true you've got a Hippogriff tattooed across your chest.' 
Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry ignored them. 
'What did you tell her?' 
' ? told her it's a Hungarian Horntail,' said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly. 'Much more macho.' 
Thanks,' said Harry, grinning. 'And what did you tell her Ron's got?' 
'A Pygmy Puff, but I didn't say where.' 
Ron scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing. 
'Watch it,' he said, pointing wamingly at Harry and Ginny. 'Just because I've given my permission doesn't mean I can't withdraw it -' 
"Tour permission",' scoffed Ginny. 'Since when did you give me permission to do anything? Anyway, you said yourself you'd rather it was Harry than Michael or Dean.' 
'Yeah, 1 would,' said Ron grudgingly. 'And just as long as you don't start snogging each other in public -' 
'You filthy hypocrite! What about you and Lavender, thrash-ing around like a pair of eels all over the place?' demanded Ginny. 
But Ron's tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June, for Harry and Ginny's time together was becoming increasingly restricted. Ginny's O.W.L.s were approaching and she was therefore forced to revise for hours into the night. On one such evening, when Ginny had retired to the library and Harry was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing his Herbology home-work but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunch-time, Hermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face. 
'I want to talk to you, Harry.' 
'What about?' said Harry suspiciously. Only the previous day, Hermione had told him off for distracting Ginny when she ought to be working hard for her examinations. 
The so-called Half-Blood Prince.' 
'Oh, not again,' he groaned. 'Will you please drop it?' 
He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his book, and his performance in Potions was suffer-ing accordingly (though Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had jocularly attributed this to Harry being lovesick). But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Prince's book, and was determined to leave it where it was while Snape remained on the lookout. 
'I'm not dropping it,' said Hermione firmly, 'until you've heard me out. Now, I've been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells -' 
'He didn't make a hobby of it -' 
'He, he - who says it's a he?' 
'We've been through this,' said Harry crossly. 'Prince, Hermione, Prince!' 
'Right!' said Hermione, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of Harry. 'Look at that! Look at the picture!' 
Harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph, yellowed with age; Ron leaned over for a look, too. The picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen. She was not pretty; she looked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy brows and a long, pallid face. Under-neath the photograph was the caption: Eileen Prince, Captain of the Hogwarts Gobstones Team. 
'So?' said Harry, scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged; it was a rather dull story about inter-school competitions. 
'Her name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Harry.' 
They looked at each other and Harry realised what Hermione was trying to say. He burst out laughing. 
'No way.' 
'What?' 
'You think she was the Half-Blood ...? Oh, come on.' 
'Well, why not? Harry, there aren't any real princes in the wizarding world! It's either a nickname, a made-up title somebody's given themselves, or it could be their actual name, couldn't it? No, listen! If, say, her father was a wizard 
whose surname was "Prince", and her mother was a Muggle, then that would make her a "half-blood Prince"!' 
'Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione ...' 
'But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!' 
'Listen, Hermione, I can tell it's not a girl. I can just tell.' 
The truth is that you don't think a girl would have been clever enough,' said Hermione angrily. 
'How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?' said Harry, stung by this. 'It's the way he writes. I just know the Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn't got anything to do with it. Where did you get this, anyway?' 
The library,' said Hermione, predictably. There's a whole collection of old Prophets up there. Well, I'm going to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can.' 
'Enjoy yourself,' said Harry irritably. 
'I will,' said Hermione. 'And the first place I'll look,' she shot at him, as she reached the portrait hole, 'is records of old Potions awards!' 
Harry scowled after her for a moment, then continued his contemplation of the darkening sky. 
'She's just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,' said Ron, returning to his copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi. 
'You don't think I'm mad, wanting that book back, do you?' 
'Course not,' said Ron robustly. 'He was a genius, the Prince. Anyway ... without his bezoar tip ...' he drew his finger significantly across his own throat, 'I wouldn't be here to discuss it, would I? I mean, I'm not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great -' 
'Nor am I,' said Harry quickly. 
'But he healed all right, didn't he? Back on his feet in no time.' 
'Yeah,' said Harry; this was perfectly true, although his con-science squirmed slightly all the same. Thanks to Snape ...' 
'You still got detention with Snape this Saturday?' Ron continued. 
'Yeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday after that,' sighed Harry. 'And he's hinting now that if I don't get all the boxes done by the end of term, we'll carry on next year.' 
He was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with Ginny. Indeed, he had frequently won-dered lately whether Snape did not know this, for he was keeping Harry later and later every time, while making pointed asides about Harry having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered. 
Harry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at his side of Jimmy Peakes, who was holding out a scroll of parchment. 
Thanks, Jimmy ... hey, it's from Dumbledore!' said Harry excitedly, unrolling the parchment and scanning it. 'He wants me to go to his office as quick as 1 can!' 
They stared at each other. 
'Blimey,' whispered Ron. 'You don't reckon ... he hasn't found ...?' 
'Better go and see, hadn't I?' said Harry, jumping to his feet. 
He hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction, throwing bits of chalk at Harry in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged Harry's defensive jinx. Once Peeves had vanished, there was silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people had already returned to their common rooms. 
And then Harry heard a scream and a crash. He stopped in his tracks, listening. 
'How - dare - you - aaaaargh!' 
The noise was coming from a corridor nearby; Harry sprinted towards it, his wand at the ready, hurtled round another corner and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor, her head covered in one of her many shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside her, one broken. 
'Professor -' 
Harry hurried forwards and helped Professor Trelawney to her feet. Some of her glittering beads had become entangled with her glasses. She hiccoughed loudly, patted her hair and pulled herself up on Harry's helping arm. 
'What happened, Professor?' 
'You may well ask!' she said shrilly. 'I was strolling along, brooding upon certain Dark portents 1 happen to have glimpsed ...' 
But Harry was not paying much attention. He had just noticed where they were standing: there on the right was the tapestry of dancing trolls and, on the left, that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall that concealed - 
'Professor, were you trying to get into the Room of Requirement?' 
'... omens I have been vouchsafed - what?' 
She looked suddenly shifty. 
The Room of Requirement,' repeated Harry. 'Were you try-ing to get in there?' 
'I - well - I didn't know students knew about -' 
'Not all of them do,' said Harry. 'But what happened? You screamed ... it sounded as though you were hurt...' 
'I - well,' said Professor Trelawney, drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes. 'I wished to - ah - deposit certain C um - personal items in the Room ...' And she muttered something about 'nasty accusations'. 
'Right,' said Harry, glancing down at the sherry bottles. 'But you couldn't get in and hide them?' 
He found this very odd; the Room had opened for him, after all, when he had wanted to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book. 
'Oh, I got in all right,' said Professor Trelawney, glaring at the wall. 'But there was somebody already in there.' 
'Somebody in -? Who?' demanded Harry. 'Who was in there?' 
' ? have no idea,' said Professor Trelawney, looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in Harry's voice. 'I walked into the Room and I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all my years of hiding - of using the Room, I mean.' 
'A voice? Saying what?' 
'I don't know that it was saying anything,' said Professor Trelawney. 'It was ... whooping.' 
'Whooping?' 
'Gleefully,' she said, nodding. 
Harry stared at her. 
'Was it male or female?' 
' ? would hazard a guess at male,' said Professor Trelawney. 
'And it sounded happy?' 
'Very happy,' said Professor Trelawney sniffily. 
'As though it was celebrating?' 
'Most definitely.' 
'And then -?' 
'And then I called out, "Who's there?"' 
'You couldn't have found out who it was without asking?' Harry asked her, slightly frustrated. 
The Inner Eye,' said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads, 'was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.' 
'Right,' said Harry hastily; he had heard about Professor Trelawney's Inner Eye all too often before. 'And did the voice say who was there?' 
'No, it did not,' she said. 'Everything went pitch black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the Room!' 
'And you didn't see that coming?' said Harry, unable to help himself. 
'No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch -' She stopped and glared at him suspiciously. 
'I think you'd better tell Professor Dumbledore,' said Harry. 'He ought to know Malfoy's celebrating - I mean, that some-one threw you out of the Room.' 
To his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion, looking haughty. 
The Headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me,' she said coldly. I am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it. If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show -' 
Her bony hand closed suddenly around Harry's wrist. 
'Again and again, no matter how I lay them out -' 
And she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls. 
'- the lightning-struck tower,' she whispered. 'Calamity. Disaster. Coming nearer all the time ...' 
'Right,' said Harry again. 'Well ... I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice and everything going dark and being thrown out of the Room ...' 
'You think so?' Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment, but Harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure. 
'I'm going to see him right now,' said Harry. 'I've got a meeting with him. We could go together.' 
'Oh, well, in that case,' said Professor Trelawney with a smile. She bent down, scooped up her sherry bottles and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blue and white vase standing in a nearby niche. 
'I miss having you in my classes, Harry,' she said soulfully, as they set off together. 'You were never much of a Seer ... but you were a wonderful Object...' 
Harry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object of Professor Trelawney's continual predictions of doom. 
'I am afraid,' she went on, 'that the nag - I'm sorry, the centaur - knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him - one Seer to another - had he not, too, sensed the distant vibra-tions of coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!' 
Her voice rose rather hysterically and Harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind. 
'Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my great-great-grandmother's gift. Those rumours have been bandied about by the jealous for years. You know what I say to such people, Harry? Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I not proved myself to him?' 
Harry mumbled something indistinct. 
'I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,' went on Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones. 'He was deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed ... I was staying at the Hog's Head, which I do not advise, incidentally - bed bugs, dear boy - but funds were low. Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room at the inn. He questioned me ... I must confess that, at first, I thought he seemed ill-disposed towards Divination ... and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day ... but then ...' 
And now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time, for he knew what had happened then: Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy about him and Voldemort. 
'... but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape!' 
'What?' 
'Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although I'm afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore - you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more dis-posed to give me a job, and I could not help thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes - Harry, dear?' 
She looked back over her shoulder, having only just real-ised that Harry was no longer with her; he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other. 
'Harry?' she repeated uncertainly. 
Perhaps his face was white, to make her look so concerned and frightened. Harry was standing stock-still as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating every-thing except the information that had been kept from him for so long ... 
It was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was Snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to Voldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunt-ing after Lily and James and their son ... 
Nothing else mattered to Harry just now. 
'Harry?' said Professor Trelawney again. 'Harry - I thought we were going to see the Headmaster together?' 
'You stay here,' said Harry through numb lips. 
'But, dear ... I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of-' 
'You stay here!' Harry repeated angrily. 
She looked alarmed as he ran past her, round the corner into Dumbledore's corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry. Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time. He did not knock upon Dumbledore's door, he hammered; and the calm voice answered 'Enter' after Harry had already flung himself into the room. 
Fawkes the phoenix looked round, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the window. Dumbledore was standing at the window look-ing out at the grounds, a long, black travelling cloak in his arms. 
'Well, Harry, I promised that you could come with me.' 
For a moment or two, Harry did not understand; the con-versation with Trelawney had driven everything else out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly. 
'Come ... with you ... ?' 
'Only if you wish it, of course.' 
'If I...' 
And then Harry remembered why he had been eager to come to Dumbledore's office in the first place. 
'You've found one? You've found a Horcrux?' 
'I believe so.' 
Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement: for several moments, Harry could not speak. 
'It is natural to be afraid,' said Dumbledore. 
'I'm not scared!' said Harry at once, and it was perfectly 
  
true; fear was one emotion he was not feeling at all. 'Which Horcrux is it? Where is it?' 
'I am not sure which it is - though I think we can rule out the snake - but I believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here, a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time: the cave in which Tom Riddle once terror-ised two children from his orphanage on their annual trip; you remember?' 
'Yes,' said Harry. 'How is it protected?' 
'I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.' Dumbledore hesitated, then said, 'Harry, I promised you that you could come with me, and I stand by that prom-ise, but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous.' 
'I'm coming,' said Harry, almost before Dumbledore had finished speaking. Boiling with anger at Snape, his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes. This seemed to show on Harry's face, for Dumbledore moved away from the window, and looked more closely at Harry, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows. 
'What has happened to you?' 
'Nothing,' lied Harry promptly. 
'What has upset you?' 
'I'm not upset.' 
'Harry, you were never a good Occlumens -' 
The word was the spark that ignited Harry's fury. 
'Snape!' he said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them. 'Snape's what's happened! He told Voldemort about the prophecy, it was him, he listened outside the door, Trelawney told me!' 
Dumbledore's expression did not change, but Harry thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun. For a long moment, Dumbledore said nothing. 
'When did you find out about this?' he asked at last. 
'Just now!' said Many, who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty. And then, suddenly, he could not stop himself. 'AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!' 
Breathing hard as though he were fighting, Harry turned away from Dumbledore, who still had not moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over. He wanted to rage and storm at Dumbledore, but he also wanted to go with him to try and destroy the Horcrux; he wanted to tell him that he was a fool-ish old man for trusting Snape, but he was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him along unless he mastered his anger ... 
'Harry,' said Dumbledore quietly. 'Please listen to me.' 
It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting. Harry paused, biting his lip, and looked into Dumbledore's lined face. 
'Professor Snape made a terrible -' 
'Don't tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!' 
'Please let me finish.' Dumbledore waited until Harry had nodded curtly, then went on. 'Professor Snape made a terrible mistake. He was still in Lord Voldemort's employ on the night he heard the first half of Professor Trelawney's prophecy. Naturally, he hastened to tell his master what he had heard, for it concerned his master most deeply. But he did not know - he had no possible way of knowing - which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onwards, or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Snape knew, that they were your mother and father -' 
Harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter. 
'He hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Haven't you noticed, Professor, how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead?' 
'You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he realised how Lord Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy, Harry. I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned -' 
'But he's a very good Occlumens, isn't he, sir?' said Harry, whose voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady. 'And isn't Voldemort convinced that Snape's on his side, even now? Professor ... how can you be sure Snape's on our side?' 
Dumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about something. At last he said, 'I am sure. I trust Severus Snape completely.' 
Harry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself. It did not work. 
'Well, I don't!' he said, as loudly as before. 'He's up to something with Draco Malfoy right now, right under your nose, and you still -' 
'We have discussed this, Harry,' said Dumbledore, and now he sounded stern again. 'I have told you my views.' 
'You're leaving the school tonight and I'll bet you haven't even considered that Snape and Malfoy might decide to -' 
To what?' asked Dumbledore, his eyebrows raised. 'What is it that you suspect them of doing, precisely?' 
'I ... they're up to something!' said Harry and his hands curled into fists as he said it. 'Professor Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement, trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard Malfoy whooping, celebrating! He's trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me he's fixed it at last and you're about to just walk out of school * without -' 
'Enough,' said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, and yet Harry fell silent at once; he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line. 'Do you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be additional protec-tion in place. Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously, Harry.' 
'I didn't -' mumbled Harry, a little abashed, but Dumbledore cut across him. 
' ? do not wish to discuss the matter any further.' 
Harry bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too far, that he had ruined his chance of accompanying Dumbledore, but Dumbledore went on, 'Do you wish to come with me tonight?' 
'Yes,' said Harry at once. 
'Very well, then: listen.' 
Dumbledore drew himself up to his full height. 
'I take you with me on one condition: that you obey any command I might give you at once, and without question.' 
'Of course.' 
'Be sure to understand me, Harry. I mean that you must follow even such orders as "run", "hide" or "go back". Do I have your word?' 
'I - yes, of course.' 
'If 1 tell you to hide, you will do so?' 
'Yes.' 
'If I tell you to flee, you will obey?' 
'Yes.' 
'If I tell you to leave me, and save yourself, you will do as I tell you?' 
'I -' 
'Harry?' 
They looked at each other for a moment. 
'Yes, sir.' 
'Very good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your Cloak and meet me in the Entrance Hall in five minutes' time.' 
Dumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window; the sun was now a ruby-red glare along the horizon. Harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase. His mind was oddly clear all of a sudden. He knew what to do. 
Ron and Hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back. 'What does Dumbledore want?' Hermione said at once. 'Harry, are you OK?' she added anxiously. 
'I'm fine,' said Harry shortly, racing past them. He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauder's Map and a pair of balled-up socks. Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, looking stunned. 
'I haven't got much time,' Harry panted, 'Dumbledore thinks I'm getting my Invisibility Cloak. Listen ...' 
Quickly he told them where he was going, and why. He did not pause either for Hermione's gasps of horror or for Ron's hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for themselves later. 
'... so you see what this means?' Harry finished at a gallop. 'Dumbledore won't be here tonight, so Malfoy's going to have another clear shot at whatever he's up to. No, listen to me!" he hissed angrily, as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. 'I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here -' He shoved the Marauder's Map into Hermione's hand. 'You've got to watch him and you've got to watch Snape, too. Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the DA. Hermione, those contact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore says he's put extra protection in the school, but if Snape's involved, he'll know what Dumbledore's protection is, and how to avoid it - but he won't be expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?' 
'Harry -' began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear. 
' ? haven't got time to argue,' said Harry curtly. Take this as well -' He thrust the socks into Ron's hands. 
Thanks,' said Ron. 'Er - why do I need socks?' 
'You need what's wrapped in them, it's the Felix Felicis. Share it between yourselves and Ginny too. Say goodbye to her from me. I'd better go, Dumbledore's waiting -' 
'No!' said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion, looking awestruck. 'We don't want it, you take it, who knows what you're going to be facing?' 
'I'Il be fine, I'll be with Dumbledore,' said Harry. 'I want to know you lot are OK ... don't look like that, Hermione, I'll see you later 
And he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole towards the Entrance Hall. 
Dumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He turned as Harry came skidding out on to the topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in his side. 
'I would like you to wear your Cloak, please,' said Dumbledore, and he waited until Harry had thrown it on before saying, 'Very good. Shall we go?' 
Dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own travelling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air. Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak, still pant-ing and sweating rather a lot. 
'But what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?' Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy and Snape. 
That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,' said Dumbledore lightly. 'I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hog's Head ... or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of disguising one's true destination.' 
They made their way down the drive in the gathering twi-light. The air was full of the smells of warm grass, lake water and wood smoke from Hagrid's cabin. It was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening. 
'Professor,' said Harry quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view, 'will we be Apparating?' 
'Yes,' said Dumbledore. 'You can Apparate now, I believe?' 
'Yes,' said Harry, 'but I haven't got a licence.' 
He felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go? 
'No matter,' said Dumbledore, 'I can assist you again.' 
They turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast as they walked and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest. Lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting. 
'- and stay out!' shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly ejecting a grubby-looking wizard. 'Oh, hello, Albus ... you're out late ...' 
'Good evening, Rosmerta, good evening ... forgive me, I'm off to the Hog's Head ... no offence, but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight...' 
A minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hog's Head's sign creaked a little, though there was no breeze. In contrast to the Three Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be completely empty. 
'It will not be necessary for us to enter,' muttered Dumbledore, glancing around. 'As long as nobody sees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm, Harry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely guiding you. On the count of three - one ... two ... three ...'
Harry turned. At once, there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part of him was being com-pressed almost past endurance and then, just when he thought he must suffocate, the invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he was standing in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air.

Chapter 26: The Cave
Harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moon-lit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand. 
"What do you think?" asked Dumbledore. He might have been asking Harry's opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic. 
"They brought the kids from the orphanage here?" asked Harry, who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip. 
"Not here, precisely," said Dumbledore. "There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, don't you?" 
Harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps. 
"But his final destination  and ours  lies a little farther on. Come." 
Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay half-submerged in water and closer to the cliff. It was a treacherous descent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his withered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were slippery with seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face. "Lumos," said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too. "You see?" said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling. "You will not object to getting a little wet?" 
"No," said Harry. 
"Then take off your Invisibility Cloak  there is no need for it now  and let us take the plunge," And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumble-dore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth. Harry pulled off his cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed. The water was icy; Harry's waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff. The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledore's wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledore's wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock. 
Then he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his sil-ver hair and dark robes gleaming. When Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air. 
Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling. 
"Yes, this is the place," said Dumbledore. 
"How can you tell?" Harry spoke in a whisper. 
"It has known magic," said Dumbledore simply. Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of 
enchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see. "This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall," said Dumbledore after a moment or two. "We need to penetrate the inner place. . . . Now it is Lord Voldemort's obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nature made. . . ." 
Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and for-ward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall. "Here," he said. "We go on through here. The entrance is con-cealed." Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise. Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an arched outline appeared there, blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack. 
"You've d-done it!" said Harry through chattering teeth, but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. Dumbledore looked around. 
"Harry, I'm so sorry, I forgot," he said; he now pointed his wand at Harry and at once, Harry's clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire. 
"Thank you," said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore had al-ready turned his attention back to the solid cave wall. He did not try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as though something extremely interesting was written on it. Harry stayed quite still; he did not want to break Dumbledores concen-tration. Then, after two solid minutes, Dumbledore said quietly, "Oh, surely not. So crude." 
"What is it, Professor?" 
"I rather think," said Dumbledore, putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop potion ingredients, "that we are required to make payment to pass." 
"Payment?" said Harry. "You've got to give the door something?" 
"Yes," said Dumbledore. "Blood, if I am not much mistaken." 
"Blood?" 
"I said it was crude," said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort had fallen short of higher standards Dumbledore expected. "The idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury." 
"Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it . . ." said Harry, who had ex-perienced enough pain not to be keen for more. 
"Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable," said Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand. 
"Professor!" protested Harry, hurrying forward as Dumbledore raised his knife. "I'll do it, I'm " He did not know what he was going to say  younger, fitter? 
But Dumbledore merely smiled. There was a flash of silver, and a spurt of scarlet; the rock face was peppered with dark, glistening drops. 
"You are very kind, Harry," said Dumbledore, now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as Snape had healed Malfoy's wound, "But your blood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have done the trick, doesn't it?" The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more, and this time it did not fade away: The blood-spattered rock within it simply vanished, leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness. "After me, I think," said Dumbledore, and he walked through the archway with Harry on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily as he went. 
An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the mid-dle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The dark-ness was somehow denser than normal darkness. 
"Let us walk," said Dumbledore quietly. "Be very careful not to step into the water. Stay close to me." He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view did not vary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless expanse of smooth, glassy blackness, in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow. Harry found the place and the silence oppressive, unnerving. 
"Professor?" he said finally. "Do you think the Horcrux is here?" 
"Oh yes," said Dumbledore. "Yes, I'm sure it is. The question is, how do we get to it?" 
"We couldn't... we couldn't just try a Summoning Charm?" Harry said, sure that it was a stupid suggestion. But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible. 
"Certainly we could," said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into him. "Why don't you do it?" 
"Me? Oh . . . okay . . ." Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft, "Accio Horcrux!" 
With a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore. 
"What was that?" 
"Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux." 
Harry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harry's heart, however, was still pounding. 
"Did you think that would happen, sir?" 
"I thought something would happen if we made an obvious at-tempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing." 
"But we don't know what the thing was," said Harry, looking at the sinisterly smooth water. 
"What the things are, you mean," said Dumbledore. "I doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?" 
"Professor?" 
"Yes, Harry?" 
"Do you think we're going to have to go into the lake?" 
"Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate." 
"You don't think the Horcrux is at the bottom?" 
"Oh no ... I think the Horcrux is in the middle." And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake. 
"So we're going to have to cross the lake to get to it?" 
"Yes, I think so." Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water mon-sters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites. . . . 
"Aha," said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledore's uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back. "So sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place." 
Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it. This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but t hrough the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip some-thing invisible. 
"Oho," said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see. Dumble-dore moved closer to the water; Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore's buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point. 
Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledore's clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water. Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood. 
"How did you know that was there?" Harry asked in astonish-ment. 
"Magic always leaves traces," said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, "sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style." 
"Is ... is this boat safe?" 
"Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux." 
"So the things in the water won't do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort's boat?" 
"I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point, realize we are not Lord Voldemort. Thus far, however, we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat." 
"But why have they let us?" asked Harry, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank. 
"Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat," said Dumbledore. "I think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he was right." 
Harry looked down into the boat. It really was very small. "It doesn't look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?" 
Dumbledore chuckled. "Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it." 
"But then  ?" 
"I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and un-qualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine." These words did nothing to raise Harrys morale; perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added, "Voldemort's mistake, Harry, Voldemort's mistake. . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. . . . Now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water." Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the boat. Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the chain onto the floor. They were crammed in together; Harry could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which be-gan to move at once. There was no sound other than the silken rus-tle of the boat's prow cleaving the water; it moved without their help, as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center. Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no waves. 
Harry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed. The boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface, grooves in the dark mirror. . . . 
And then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches below the surface. "Professor!" he said, and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water. 
"Harry?" 
"I think I saw a hand in the water  a human hand!" 
"Yes, I am sure you did," said Dumbledore calmly. 
Harry stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat. 
"So that thing that jumped out of the water  ?" But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke. "There are bodies in here!" said Harry, and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own. 
"Yes," said Dumbledore placidly, "but we do not need to worry about them at the moment." 
"At the moment?" Harry repeated, tearing his gaze from the water to look at Dumbledore. 
"Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us," said Dumbledore. "There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more." Harry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and, what was more, he did not believe that they were not dangerous. 
"But one of them jumped," he said, trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledore's. "When I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake." 
"Yes," said Dumbledore. "I am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Harry," Dumbledore added with a smile, in response to Harry's bewildered expression. 
"Oh . . . right. . ." said Harry quickly. He turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend now that he was not scared. The great black lake, teeming with the dead ... It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis. . . . He suddenly wished he had said a better good-bye to them . . . and he hadn't seen Ginny at all. . . 
"Nearly there," said Dumbledore cheerfully. Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping gently into something that Harry could not see at first, but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake. "Careful not to touch the water," said Dumbledore again as Harry climbed out of the boat. 
The island was no larger than Dumbledore's office, an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light, which looked much brighter when viewed close to. Harry squinted at it; at first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal. Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed. Side by side, they looked down into it. The basin was full of an emerald liq-uid emitting that phosphorescent glow. 
"What is it?" asked Harry quietly. 
"I am not sure," said Dumbledore. "Something more worrisome than blood and bodies, however." Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his black-ened hand, and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion. 
"Sir, no, don't touch  !" 
"I cannot touch," said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. "See? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try." 
Staring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion. He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and flexible air. 
"Out of the way, please, Harry," said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of the-potion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except per haps that the potion glowed a little brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while Dumbledore with-drew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again. 
"You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?" 
"Oh yes." Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. "But how to reach it? This potion cannot be pen-etrated by hand, Vanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made to change its nature." Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere. "I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk." 
"What?" said Harry. "No!" 
"Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths." 
"But what if what if it kills you?" 
"Oh, I doubt that it would work like that," said Dumbledore easily. "Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island." Harry couldn't believe it. Was this more of Dumbledore's insane determination to see good in everyone? 
"Sir," said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, "sir, this is Voldemort we're " 
"I'm sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not want to im-mediately kill the person who reached this island," Dumbledore corrected himself. "He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his de-fenses and, most importantly of all, why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes." 
Harry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard. "Undoubtedly," he said, finally, "this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux. It might paralyze me, cause me to forget what I am here for, create so much pain I am dis-tracted, or render me incapable in some other way. This being the case, Harry, it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth. You understand?" 
Their eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange, green light. Harry did not speak. Was this why he had been invited along  so that he could force-feed Dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain? 
"You remember," said Dumbledore, "the condition on which I brought you with me?" 
Harry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin. 
"But what if?" 
"You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?" 
"Yes, but" 
"I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?" 
"Yes," said Harry, "but " 
"Well, then," said Dumbledore, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, "you have my orders." 
"Why can't I drink the potion instead?" asked Harry desperately. 
"Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable," said Dumbledore. "Once and for all, Harry, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?" 
"Couldn't  ?" 
"Do I have it?" 
"But" 
"Your word, Harry." 
"I all right, but" 
Before Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore low-ered the crystal goblet into the potion. For a split second, Harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the gob-let, but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth. "Your good health, Harry." 
And he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb. 
"Professor?" he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass. "How do you feel?" 
Dumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry wondered whether he was in pain. Dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled it, and drank once more. 
In silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion. Then, halfway through the fourth goblet, he staggered and fell for-ward against the basin. His eyes were still closed, his breathing heavy. 
"Professor Dumbledore?" said Harry, his voice strained. "Can you hear me?" 
Dumbledore did not answer. His face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep, but dreaming a horrible dream. His grip on the goblet was slackening; the potion was about to spill from it. Harry reached forward and grasped the crystal cup, holding it steady. "Professor, can you hear me?" he repeated loudly, his voice echo-ing around the cavern. 
Dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry did not recognize, for he had never heard Dumbledore frightened like this. 
"I don't want. . . Don't make me ..." 
Harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well, at the crooked nose and half-moon spectacles, and did not know what to do. 
". . . don't like . . . want to stop . . ." moaned Dumbledore. 
"You . . . you can't stop, Professor," said Harry. "You've got to keep drinking, remember? You told me you had to keep drinking. Here . . ." Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry forced the goblet back toward Dumbledore's mouth and tipped it, so that Dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside. 
"No ..." he groaned, as Harry lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him. "I don't want to. ... I don't want to. . . . Let me go. . . ." 
"Its all right, Professor," said Harry, his hand shaking. "Its all right, I'm here " 
"Make it stop, make it stop," moaned Dumbledore. 
"Yes.. . yes, this'll make it stop," lied Harry. He tipped the con-tents of the goblet into Dumbledore's open mouth. Dumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around the vast chamber, across the dead black water. 
"No, no, no, no, I can't, I can't, don't make me, I don't warn to. . . ." 
"It's all right, Professor, it's all right!" said Harry loudly, his hands shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth goblei ful of potion; the basin was now half empty. "Nothing's happening to you, you're safe, it isn't real, I swear it isn't real  take this, now, take this..." And obediently, Dumbledore drank, as though it was an anti-dote Harry offered him, but upon draining the goblet, he sank to his knees, shaking uncontrollably. 
"Its all my fault, all my fault," he sobbed. "Please make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please make it stop and I'll never, never again ..." 
"This will make it stop, Professor," Harry said, his voice crack-ing as he tipped the seventh glass of potion into Dumbledore's mouth. 
Dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers sur-rounded him; his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from Harry's trembling hands as he moaned, "Don't hurt them, don't hurt them, please, please, its my fault, hurt me instead ..." 
"Here, drink this, drink this, you'll be all right," said Harry des-perately, and once again Dumbledore obeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot. And now he fell forward, screaming again, hammering his fists upon the ground, while Harry filled the ninth goblet. 
"Please, please, please, no ... not that, not that, I'll do any-thing ..." 
"Just drink, Professor, just drink . . ." 
Dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst, but when he had finished, he yelled again as though his insides were on fire. "No more, please, no more ..." 
Harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin. "We're nearly there, Professor. Drink this, drink it. ..." 
He supported Dumbledore's shoulders and again, Dumbledore drained the glass; then Harry was on his feet once more, refilling the goblet as Dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever, "I want to die! I want to die! Make it stop, make it stop, I want to die!" 
"Drink this, Professor. Drink this. . . ." 
Dumbledore drank, and no sooner had he finished than he yelled, "KILL ME!" 
"This  this one will!" gasped Harry. "Just drink this .. . It'll be over ... all over!" Dumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over onto his face. 
"No!" shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, flung himself down beside Dumbledore, and heaved him over onto his back; Dumbledore's glasses were askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed. "No." said Harry, shaking Dumbledore, "no, you're not dead, you said it wasn't poison, wake up, wake up  Rennervate!" he cried, his wand pointing at Dumbledores chest; there was a flash of red light but nothing happened. "Rennervate  sir  please " 
Dumbledores eyelids flickered; Harry's heart leapt, "Sir, are you  ?" 
"Water," croaked Dumbledore. 
"Water," panted Harry. "Yes " He leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin; he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it. 
"Aguamenti!" he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand. The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips  but it was empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant. "But I had some  wait  Aguamenti!" said Harry again, pointing his wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear wa-ter gleamed within it, but as he approached Dumbledores mouth, the water vanished again. "Sir, I'm trying, I'm trying!" said Harry desperately, but he did not think that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great, rattling breaths that sounded agoniz-ing. "Aguamenti Aguamenti AGUAMENTI!" 
The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumble-dores breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so ... He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish. "Sir  here!" Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledores face. 
It was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water. A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist, and the creature to whom it be-longed was pulling him, slowly, backward across the rock. The sur-face of the lake was no longer mirror-smooth; it was churning, and everywhere Harry looked, white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water, men and women and children with sunken, sightless eyes were moving toward the rock: an army of the dead rising from the black water. 
"Petrificus Totalus!" yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the smooth, soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm. It released him, falling backward into the water with a splash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering. 
"Petrificus Totalus!" Harry bellowed again, backing away as he swiped his wand through the air; six or seven of them crumpled, but more were coming toward him. "Impedimenta! Incarcerous!" A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, "Sectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!" But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshlcv. arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, anil he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemorts shattered soul... 
But then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit the ground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing his arms, then scrambled back up, raising his wand and staring around. 
Dumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surround-ing Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth. The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, blindly, to es-cape the fire in which they were enclosed. . . . 
Dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the waters edge, where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters. 
Harry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat. Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the black water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface. 
"Sir," panted Harry, "sir, I forgot  about fire  they were coming at me and I panicked " 
"Quite understandable," murmured Dumbledore. Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was. 
They reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out, then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. The moment that Dum-bledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The little boat sank into the water once more; clanking and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake too. Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall. 
"I am weak..." he said. 
"Don't worry, sir," said Harry at once, anxious about Dumbledore's extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion. "Don't worry, I'll get us back. . . . Lean on me, sir. . . ." 
And pulling Dumbledore's uninjured arm around his shoulders, Harry guided his headmaster back around the lake, bearing most of his weight. 
"The protection was . . . after all... well-designed," said Dum-bledore faintly. "One alone could not have done it. ... You did well, very well, Harry. ..." 
"Don't talk now," said Harry, fearing how slurred Dumbledore's voice had become, how much his feet dragged. "Save your energy, sir. . . . We'll soon be out of here. . . ." 
"The archway will have sealed again. . . . My knife ..." ' 
"There's no need, I got cut on the rock," said Harry firmly. "Just tell me where. . . ." 
"Here . . ." 
Harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: Having re-ceived its tribute of blood, the archway reopened instantly. They crossed the outer cave, and Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff. 
"It's going to be all right, sir," Harry said over and over again, more worried by Dumbledore's silence than he had been by his weakened voice. "We're nearly there. ... I can Apparate us both back . . . Don't worry. . . ." 
"I am not worried, Harry," said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. "I am with you." 

Chapter 27: The Lightning-Struck Tower


Once back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore on to the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet. Sodden and shivering, Dumbledore's weight still upon him, Harry con- centrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledore's arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forwards into that feeling of horrible compression. 
He knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: the smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one horrible moment Harry's imagination showed him more Inferi creeping towards him around the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that noth-ing was stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows. 
'We did it, Professor!' Harry whispered with difficulty; he suddenly realised that he had a searing stitch in his chest. 'We did it! We got the Horcrux!' 
Dumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore off-balance; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp. 
'Sir, are you all right?' 
'I've been better,' said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners of his mouth twitched. That potion ... was no health drink ..." 
And to Harry's horror, Dumbledore sank on to the ground. 
'Sir - it's OK, sir, you're going to be all right, don't worry -' 
He looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing. 
'We need to get you up to the school, sir ... Madam Pomfrey ...' 
'No,' said Dumbledore. 'It is ... Professor Snape whom I need ... but I do not think ... I can walk very far just yet ...' 
'Right - sir, listen - I'm going to knock on a door, find a place you can stay - then I can run and get Madam -' 
'Severus,' said Dumbledore clearly. 'I need Severus ...' 
'All right then, Snape - but I'm going to have to leave you for a moment so I can -' 
Before Harry could make a move, however, he heard run- ning footsteps. His heart leapt: somebody had seen, somebody knew they needed help - and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street towards them on high-heeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressing-gown embroidered with dragons. 
'I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! Thank goodness, thank goodness, I couldn't think what to - but what's wrong with Albus?' 
She came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide-eyed, at Dumbledore. 
'He's hurt,' said Harry. 'Madam Rosmerta, can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him?' 
'You can't go up there alone! Don't you realise - haven't you seen -?' 
'If you help me support him,' said Harry, not listening to her, 'I think we can get him inside -' 
'What has happened?' asked Dumbledore. 'Rosmerta, what's wrong?' 
The - the Dark Mark, Albus.' 
And she pointed into the sky, in the direction of Hogwarts. Dread flooded Harry at the sound of the words ... he turned and looked. 
There it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blaz- ing green skull with a serpent tongue, the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building ... wherever they had murdered ... 
'When did it appear?' asked Dumbledore, and his hand clenched painfully upon Harry's shoulder as he struggled to his feet. 
'Must have been minutes ago, it wasn't there when I put the cat out, but when I got upstairs -' 
'We need to return to the castle at once,' said Dumbledore. 'Rosmerta,' and though he staggered a little, he seemed wholly in command of the situation, 'we need transport - brooms -' 
'I've got a couple behind the bar,' she said, looking very frightened. 'Shall I run and fetch -?' 
'No, Harry can do it.' 
Harry raised his wand at once. 
'Accio Rosmerta's brooms.'
A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to Harry's side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly, at waist height. 
'Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,' said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest him. 'It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realised anything is wrong ... Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak.' 
Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom; Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back towards her pub as Harry and Dumble-dore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air. As they sped towards the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: he was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard flying behind him in the night air. And Harry, too, looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind ... 
How long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione and Ginny's luck run out by now? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or some other member of the DA? And if it was ... he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors, he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds ... would he be responsible, again, for the death of a friend? 
As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the bound-ary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle, so that they could enter at speed. The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle. Did that mean the death had occurred there? 
Dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting; Harry landed next to him seconds later and looked around. 
The ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed. There was no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the death, of a body. 
'What does it mean?' Harry asked Dumbledore, looking up at the green skull with its serpent's tongue glinting evilly above them. 'Is it the real Mark? Has someone definitely been - Professor?' 
In the dim green glow from the Mark Harry saw Dumble-dore clutching at his chest with his blackened hand. 
'Go and wake Severus,' said Dumbledore faintly but clearly. Tell him what has happened and bring him to me. Do noth- ing else, speak to nobody else and do not remove your Cloak. I shall wait here.' 
'But -' 
'You swore to obey me, Harry - go!' 
Harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral stair-case, but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side. He looked round at Dumbledore, who gestured to him to retreat. Harry backed away, drawing his wand as he did so. 
The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted: 'Expelliarmus!'
Harry's body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself fall back against the Tower wall, propped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or speak. He could not understand how it had happened - Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm - 
Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore's wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and under-stood ... Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilised Harry, and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself. 
Standing against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress. He merely looked across at his disarmer and said, 'Good evening, Draco.' 
Malfoy stepped forwards, glancing around quickly to check that he and Dumbledore were alone. His eyes fell upon the second broom. 
'Who else is here?' 
'A question 1 might ask you. Or are you acting alone?' 
Harry saw Malfoy's pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark. 
'No,' he said. 'I've got back-up. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.' 
'Well, well,' said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was show- ing him an ambitious homework project. 'Very good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?' 
'Yeah,' said Malfoy, who was panting. 'Right under your nose and you never realised!' 
'Ingenious,' said Dumbledore. 'Yet ... forgive me ... where are they now? You seem unsupported.' 
They met some of your guard. They're having a fight down below. They won't be long ... I came on ahead. I - I've got a job to do.' 
'Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,' said Dumbledore softly. 
There was silence. Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible, paralysed body, staring at the two of them, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eaters' distant fight, and in front of him, Draco Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore who, incredibly, smiled. 
'Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.' 
'How do you know?' said Malfoy at once. 
He seemed to realise how childish the words had sounded; Harry saw him flush in the Mark's greenish light. 
'You don't know what I'm capable of,' said Malfoy more forcefully, 'you don't know what I've done!' 
'Oh, yes, I do,' said Dumbledore mildly. 'You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble attempts ... so feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your heart has been really in it...' 
'It has been in it!' said Malfoy vehemently. 'I've been work- ing on it all year, and tonight -' 
Somewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry heard a muffled yell. Malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder. 
'Somebody is putting up a good fight,' said Dumbledore conversationally. 'But you were saying ... yes, you have man-aged to introduce Death Eaters into my school which, I admit, I thought impossible ... how did you do it?' 
But Malfoy said nothing: he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralysed as Harry was. 
'Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,' suggested Dumbledore. 'What if your back-up has been thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps realised, there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight, too. And after all, you don't really need help ... I have no wand at the moment ... I cannot defend myself.' 
Malfoy merely stared at him. 
'I see,' said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither
moved nor spoke. 'You are afraid to act until they join
you.'? 
'I'm not afraid!' snarled Malfoy, though he still made no move to hurt Dumbledore. 'It's you who should be scared!' 
'But why? I don't think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe ... so tell me, while we wait for your friends ... how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.' 
Malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout, or to vomit. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand pointing directly at the latter's heart. Then, as though he could not help himself, he said, '1 had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one's used for years. The one Montague got lost in last year.' 
'Aaaah.' 
Dumbledore's sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a moment. 
That was clever ... there is a pair, I take it?' 
'The other's in Borgin and Burkes,' said Malfoy, 'and they make a kind of passage between them. Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the Cabinet was travelling between them, but he couldn't make anyone hear him ... in the end he managed to Apparate out, even though he'd never passed his test. He nearly died doing it. Everyone thought it was a really good story, but I was the only one who realised what it meant - even Borgin didn't know - 1 was the one who realised there could be a way into Hogwarts through the Cabinets if I fixed the broken one.' 
'Very good,' murmured Dumbledore. 'So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you ... a clever plan, a very clever plan ... and, as you say, right under my nose ...' 
'Yeah,' said Malfoy who, bizarrely, seemed to draw courage and comfort from Dumbledore's praise. 'Yeah, it was!' 
'But there were times,' Dumbledore went on, 'weren't there, when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the Cabinet? And you resorted to crude and badly judged meas-ures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands ... poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink ...' 
'Yeah, well, you still didn't realise who was behind that stuff, did you?' sneered Malfoy, as Dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts, the strength in his legs apparently fading, and Harry struggled fruitlessly, mutely, against the enchantment binding him. 
'As a matter of fact, I did,' said Dumbledore. 'I was sure it was you.' 
'Why didn't you stop me, then?' Malfoy demanded. 
'I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders -' 
'He hasn't been doing your orders, he promised my mother -' 
'Of course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but -' 
'He's a double-agent, you stupid old man, he isn't working for you, you just think he is!' 
'We must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens that I trust Professor Snape -' 
'Well, you're losing your grip, then!' sneered Malfoy. 'He's been offering me plenty of help - wanting all the glory for himself - wanting a bit of the action - "What are you doing? Did you do the necklace, that was stupid, it could have blown everything -" But I haven't told him what I've been doing in the Room of Requirement, he's going to wake up tomorrow and it'll all be over and he won't be the Dark Lord's favourite any more, he'll be nothing compared to me, nothing!' 
'Very gratifying,' said Dumbledore mildly. 'We all like* appreciation for our own hard work, of course ... but you must have had an accomplice, all the same ... someone in Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Katie the - the - aaaah 
Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep. 
'... of course ... Rosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?' 
'Got there at last, have you?' Malfoy taunted. 
There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at Dumbledore, who went on, 'So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied? And the poisoned mead ... well, naturally, Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn, believing that it was to be my Christmas present ... yes, very neat ... very neat ... poor Mr Filch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmerta's ... tell me, how have you been communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored.' 
'Enchanted coins,' said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to keep talking, though his wand hand was shaking badly. 'I had one and she had the other and 1 could send her messages -' 
'Isn't that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledore's Army used last year?' asked Dumbledore. His voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it. 
'Yeah, I got the idea from them,' said Malfoy, with a twisted smile. 'I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger, as well, I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognising potions ...' 


Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Katie the - the - aaaah 
Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep. 
'... of course ... Rosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?' 
'Got there at last, have you?' Malfoy taunted.

'Please do not use that offensive word in front of me,' said Dumbledore. 
Malfoy gave a harsh laugh. 
'You care about me saying "Mudblood" when I'm about to kill you?' 
'Yes, I do,' said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain upright. 'But as for being about to kill me, Draco, you have had several long minutes now. We are quite alone. I am more defenceless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted ...' 
Malfoy's mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he had tasted something very bitter. 
'Now, about tonight,' Dumbledore went on, 'I am a little puzzled about how it happened ... you knew that I had left the school? But of course,' he answered his own question, 'Rosmerta saw me leaving, she tipped you off using your ingenious coins, I'm sure ...' 
'That's right,' said Malfoy. 'But she said you were just going for a drink, you'd be back ...' 
'Well, I certainly did have a drink ... and I came back ... after a fashion,' mumbled Dumbledore. 'So you decided to spring a trap for me?' 
'We decided to put the Dark Mark over the Tower and get you to hurry up here, to see who'd been killed,' said Malfoy. 'And it worked!' 
'Well ... yes and no ...' said Dumbledore. 'But am I to take it, then, that nobody has been murdered?' 
'Someone's dead,' said Malfoy and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it. 'One of your people ... I don't know who, it was dark ... I stepped over the body ... I was* supposed to be waiting up here when you got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way ...' 
'Yes, they do that,' said Dumbledore. 
There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where Dumbledore, Malfoy and Harry stood, and Harry's heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest ... someone was dead ... Malfoy had stepped over the body ... but who was it? 
There is little time, one way or another,' said Dumbledore. 'So let us discuss your options, Draco.' 
'My options!' said Malfoy loudly. 'I'm standing here with a wand - I'm about to kill you -' 
'My dear boy, let us have no more pretence about that. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first Disarmed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.' 
'I haven't got any options!' said Malfoy, and he was sud- denly as white as Dumbledore. 'I've got to do it! He'll kill me! He'll kill my whole family!' 
'I appreciate the difficulty of your position,' said Dumbledore. 'Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realised that I suspected you.' 
Malfoy winced at the sound of the name. 
'I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,' continued Dumbledore. 'But now at last we can speak plainly to each other ... no harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived ... I can help you, Draco.' 
'No, you can't,' said Malfoy, his wand hand shaking very badly indeed. 'Nobody can. He told me to do it or he'll kill me. I've got no choice.' 
'Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban ... when the time comes we can protect him too ... come over to the right side, Draco ... you are not a killer ...' 
Malfoy stared at Dumbledore. 
'But I got this far, didn't I?' he said slowly. They thought I'd die in the attempt, but I'm here ... and you're in my power ... I'm the one with the wand ... you're at my mercy ...' 
'No, Draco,' said Dumbledore quietly. 'It is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now.' 
Malfoy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand hand still trembling. Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction - 
But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs and a second later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door on to the ram-parts. Still paralysed, his eyes staring unblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon four strangers: it seemed the Death Eaters had won the fight below. 
A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle. 
'Dumbledore cornered!' he said, and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly. 'Dumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well done, Draco, well done!' 
'Good evening, Amycus,' said Dumbledore calmly, as though welcoming the man to a tea party. 'And you've brought Alecto too ... charming ...' 
The woman gave an angry little titter. 
Think your little jokes'll help you on your death bed, then?' she jeered. 
'Jokes? No, no, these are manners,' replied Dumbledore. 
'Do it,' said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a big, rangy man with matted grey hair and whiskers, whose black Death Eater's robes looked uncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none that Harry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat and, unmistakeably, of blood coming from him. His filthy hands had long yellowish nails. 
'Is that you, Fenrir?' asked Dumbledore. 
That's right,' rasped the other. 'Pleased to see me, Dumbledore?' 
'No, I cannot say that I am ...' 
Fenrir Greyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly, obscenely. 
'But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.' 
'Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now? This is most unusual ... you have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month?' 
That's right,' said Greyback. 'Shocks you, that, does it, Dumbledore? Frightens you?' 
'Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,' said Dumbledore. 'And, yes, I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you, of all people, into the school where his friends live...' 
'I didn't,' breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at Greyback; he did not seem to want to even glance at him. 'I didn't know he was going to come -' 
'I wouldn't want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore,' rasped Greyback. 'Not when there are throats to be ripped out ... delicious, delicious ...' 
And he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth, leering at Dumbledore. 
'1 could do you for afters, Dumbledore ...' 
'No,' said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, brutal-looking face. 'We've got orders. Draco's got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.' 
Malfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledore's face, which was even paler, and rather lower than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall. 
'He's not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!' said the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sister's wheezing giggles. 'Look at him - what's happened to you, then, Dumby?' 
'Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,' said Dumbledore. 'Old age, in short ... one day, perhaps, it will happen to you ... if you are lucky ...' 
'What's that mean, then, what's that mean?' yelled the Death Eater, suddenly violent. 'Always the same, weren't yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing, I don't even know why the Dark Lord's bothering to kill yeh! Come on, Draco, do it!' 
But at that moment, there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted, 'They've blocked the stairs - Reducto! REDUCTO!'
Harry's heart leapt: so these four had not eliminated all opposition, but merely broken through the fight to the top of the Tower, and, by the sound of it, created a barrier behind them - 
'Now, Draco, quickly!' said the brutal-faced man angrily. 
But Malfoy's hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim. 
Til do it,' snarled Greyback, moving towards Dumbledore with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared. 
'I said no!' shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking furious. Harry's heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledore's spell -if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the Cloak - 
'Draco, do it, or stand aside so one of us -' screeched the woman, but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy. 
'We've got a problem, Snape,' said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, 'the boy doesn't seem able -' 
But somebody else had spoken Snape's name, quite softly. 
'Severus ...' 
The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading. 
Snape said nothing, but walked forwards and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed. 
Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face. 
'Severus ... please ..." 
Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore. 
'Avada Kedavra!'
A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape's wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry's scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air: for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backwards, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight. 

Chapter 28: Flight of the Prince
Harry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not happened. . . . It could not have happened. ...
"Out of here, quickly," said Snape.
He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, Harry realized he could move again. What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door. 
"Petrificus Totalus!" 
The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase. 
Terror tore at Harry;s heart. ... He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. ... Somehow the two things were linked. ... He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. ... Dumbledore could not have died. ...
He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised. The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, "It's over, time to go!" and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: it was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat -
"Petrificus Totalus!"
Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: "Crucio - Crucio - you can't dance forever, pretty-" 
"Impedimenta!" yelled Harry.
His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window -
"Harry, where did you come from?" Ginny cried, but there was no time to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape -
"Take that!" shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across someone's legs. Looking around, he saw Neville's pale, round face flat against the floor. "Neville, are you - ?"
"M'all right," muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach, "Harry . . . Snape 'n' Malfoy . . . ran past. . ."
"I know, I'm on it!" said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. . . .
He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors - perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked -
He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken. . . .
He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood.
"Harry! We heard a noise, and someone said something aboui the Dark Mark -" began Ernie Macmillan.
"Out of the way!" yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the flagstones below.
Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate - by the looks of them, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Snape and Malfoy. ...
The cold night air ripped at Harry's lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse -
Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Hagrid. . . not Hagrid too . . .
Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him. . . .
"Impedimenta!" he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after Snape.
And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrids immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate -
Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snape's back, and yelled, "Stupefy!"
He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape's head; Snape shouted, "Run, Draco!"and turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously.
"Cruc - "
But Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet before he could complete it; Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled, "Incendio!" Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Hagrid's house was on fire.
"Fang's in there, yer evil - !" Hagrid bellowed.
"Cruc -" yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry could see him sneering.
"No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!" he shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagrid's yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. "You haven't got the nerve or the ability -"
"Incarc-"Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm.
"Fight back!" Harry screamed at him. "Fight back, you cowardly-----" 
"Coward, did you call me, Potter?" shouted Snape. "Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?" "Stupe-"
"Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!" sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more. "Now come!" he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry. "It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up -"
"Impedi -"
But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit Harry; he keeled over in the grass. Someone was screaming, he would surely die of this agony, Snape was going to torture him to death or madness -
"No!" roared Snape's voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, "Have you forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord - we are to leave him! Go! Go!"
And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater obeyed, running toward the gates. Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself - 
"Sectum - "
Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snape's face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi -
"No, Potter!" screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, ;un\ this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore hadl been. Snape's pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore.
"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them - I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don't think so . . . no"
Harry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight.
"Kill me then," panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and contempt. "Kill me like you killed him, you coward -"
"DON'T -" screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them - "CALL ME COWARD!"
And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech -
Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school's boundaries.
"Hagrid," muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. "HAGRID?"
He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs.
"Yeh all righ', Harry? Yeh all righ'? Speak ter me, Harry. . .."
Hagrids huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fang's reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him.
"I'm all right," panted Harry. "Are you?" "'Course I am . . . take more'n that ter finish me."
Hagrid put his hands under Harry's arms and raised him up with such force that Harry's feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again. He could see blood trickling down Hagrid's cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.
"We should put out your house," said Harry, "the charm's 'Aguamenti' ..."
"Knew it was summat like that," mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, "Aguamenti!"
A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured "Aguamenti" too: Together, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.
"S'not too bad," said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck. "Nothin Dumbledore won' be able to put righ' . . ."
Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.
"Hagrid ..."
"I was bindin' up a couple o' bowtruckle legs when I heard 'em coming," said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. "They'll bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . ."
"Hagrid . . ."
"But what happened, Harry? I jus' saw them Death Eaters run-nin down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin' with 'em? Where's he gone - was he chasin' them?"
"He . . ." Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke. "Hagrid, he killed . . ."
"Killed?" said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. "Snape killed? What're yeh on abou', Harry?"
"Dumbledore," said Harry. "Snape killed .. . Dumbledore."
Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending.
"Dumbledore wha, Harry?"
"He's dead. Snape killed him...."
"Don' say that," said Hagrid roughly. "Snape kill Dumbledore - don' be stupid, Harry. Wha's made yeh say tha'?"
"I saw it happen." , ,..
"Yeh couldn' have."
"I saw it, Hagrid."
Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. ...
"What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters," Hagrid said confidently. "I suppose he's gotta keep his cover. Look, let's get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. ..."
Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. ... As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. . . .
The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned people were creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harry's eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought
Dumbledore's body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward it.
"What're they all lookin' at?" said Hagrid, as he and Harry approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles. "Wha's that lyin' on the grass?" Hagrid added sharply, heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating. "See it, Harry? Right at the foot of the tower? Under where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh don' think someone got thrown - ?"
Hagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them. What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest. . . .
He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap.
Harry heard Hagrid's moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet.
Dumbledore's eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the half-moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he help-----
The crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a long time, he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down.
The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Dumbledore's pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground. And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, as he picked it up, that there was something wrong-----
He turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherins mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been.
Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him: 
To the Dark Lord
I now I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who dicovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. 
I face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more.
R.A.B. 
Harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant. Only one thing mattered: This was not a Horcrux. Dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing. Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl.

Chapter 29: The Phoenix Lament
C 'mere, Harry ..." 
"No." 
"Yeh can' stay here, Harry. ... Come on, now...." "No."
He did not want to leave Dumbledores side, he did not want to move anywhere. Hagrid's hand on his shoulder was trembling. Then another voice said, "Harry, come on."
A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward. He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it. Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize, from a trace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Ginny who was leading him back into the castle. Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but Harry and Ginny walked on, back up the steps into the entrance hall. Faces swam on the edges of Harry's vision, people were peering at him, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase.
"We're going to the hospital wing," said Ginny.
"I'm not hurt," said Harry. !
"It's McGonagalls orders," said Ginny. "Everyone's up there, Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone -"
Fear stirred in Harry's chest again: He had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind.
"Ginny, who else is dead?" 
"Don't worry, none of us."
"But the Dark Mark - Malfoy said he stepped over a body -"
"He stepped over Bill, but its all right, he's alive."
There was something in her voice, however, that Harry knew boded ill.
"Are you sure?"
"Of course I'm sure . . . he's a - a bit of a mess, that's all. Greyback attacked him. Madam Pomfrey says he won't - won't look the same anymore. . . ."
Ginny's voice trembled a little.
"We don't really know what the aftereffects will be - I mean, Greyback being a werewolf, but not transformed at the time."
"But the others . . . There were other bodies on the ground. . . ."
"Neville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt, but Madam Pomfrey says they'll be all right. And a Death Eater's dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhere - Harry, if we hadn't had your Felix potion, I think we'd all have been killed, but everything seemed to just miss us -"
They had reached the hospital wing. Pushing open the doors, Harry saw Neville lying, apparently asleep, in a bed near the door. Ron, Hermione, Luna, Tonks, and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors opening, they all looked up. Hermione ran to Harry and hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking anxious.
"Are you all right, Harry?" 
"I'm fine.... How's Bill?" 
Nobody answered. Harry looked over Hermione's shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Bill's pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment. Harry remembered how Snape had mended Malfoy's Sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand.
"Can't you fix them with a charm or something?" he asked the matron.
"No charm will work on these," said Madam Pomfrey. "I've tried everything I know, but there is no cure for werewolf bites."
"But he wasn't bitten at the full moon," said Ron, who was gazing down into his brother's face as though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring. "Greyback hadn't transformed, so surely Bill won't be a - a real - ?" :
He looked uncertainly at Lupin.
"No, I don't think that Bill will be a true werewolf," said Lupin, "but that does not mean that there won't be some contamination. Those are cursed wounds. They are unlikely ever to heal fully, and - and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on."
"Dumbledore might know something that'd work, though," Ron said. "Where is he? Bill fought those maniacs on Dumbledore's orders, Dumbledore owes him, he can't leave him in this state -"
"Ron - Dumbledores dead," said Ginny.
"No!" Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry, as though hoping the latter might contradict her, but when Harry did nor, Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Bill's bed, his hands over his face. Harry had never seen Lupin lose control before; he felt as though he was intruding upon something private, indecent. He turned away and caught Ron's eye instead, exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what Ginny had said.
"How did he die?" whispered Tonks. "How did it happen?"
"Snape killed him," said Harry. "I was there, I saw it. We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because that's where the Mark was. . . . Dumbledore was ill, he was weak, but I think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs. He immobilized me, I couldn't do anything, I was under the Invisibility Cloak - and then Malfoy came through the door and disarmed him -"
Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned. Luna's mouth trembled.
"- more Death Eaters arrived - and then Snape - and Snape did it. The Avada Kedavra." Harry couldn't go on.
Madam Pomfrey burst into tears. Nobody paid her any attention except Ginny, who whispered, "Shh! Listen!"
Gulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. And Harry felt, as he had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside him, not without: It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows.
How long they all stood there, listening, he did not know, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward. Like all the rest, she bore marks of the recent battle: There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.
"Molly and Arthur are on their way," she said, and the spell of the music was broken: Everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances, turning again to look at Bill, or else to rub their own eyest shake their heads. "Harry, what happened? According to Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when he - when it happened. He says Professor Snape was involved in some -" "Snape killed Dumbledore," said Harry.
She stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled herself together, ran forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under McGonagall.
"Snape," repeated McGonagall faintly, falling into the chair. "We all wondered . . . but he trusted . . . always . . . Snape... I can't believe it. ..."
"Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens," said Lupin, his voice uncharacteristically harsh. "We always knew that."
"But Dumbledore swore he was on our side!" whispered Tonks. "I always thought Dumbledore must know something about Snape that we didn't. ..." .
"He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape," muttered Professor McGonagall, now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartan-edged handkerchief. "I mean . . . with Snapes history ... of course people were bound to wonder. . . but Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snape's repentance was absolutely genuine-----Wouldn't hear a word against him!"
"I'd love to know what Snape told him to convince him," said Tonks.
"I know," said Harry, and they all turned to look at him. "Snape passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadn't realized what he was doing, he was really sorry he'd done it, sorry that they were dead."
They all stared at him.
"And Dumbledore believed that?" said Lupin incredulously. "Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead? Snape hated James. . . ."
"And he didn't think my mother was worth a damn either," said Harry, "because she was Muggle-born... 'Mudblood,' he called her. ..."
Nobody asked how Harry knew this. All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock, trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened.
"This is all my fault," said Professor McGonagall suddenly. She looked disoriented, twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands. "My fault. I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come and help us! If I hadn't alerted Snape to what was going on, he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters. I don't think he knew they were there before Filius told him, I don't think he knew they were coming."
"It isn't your fault, Minerva," said Lupin firmly. "We all wanted more help, we were glad to think Snape was on his way...."
"So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eaters' side?" asked Harry, who wanted every detail of Snape's duplicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear vengeance.
"I don't know exactly how it happened," said Professor McGonagall distractedly. "It's all so confusing. . . . Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case . . . Remus, Bill, and Nymphadora were to join us ... and so we patrolled. All seemed quiet. Every secret passageway out of the school was covered. We knew nobody could fly in. There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle. I still don't know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered. . . ."
"I do," said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed. "So they got in through the Room of Requirement."
Almost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione, both of whom looked devastated.
"I messed up, Harry," said Ron bleakly. "We did like you told us: We checked the Marauder's Map and we couldn't see Malfoy on it, so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me, Ginny, and Neville went to keep watch on it... but Malfoy got past us."
"He came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch," said Ginny. "He was on his own, clutching that awful shriveled arm -"
"His Hand of Glory," said Ron. "Gives light only to the holder, remember?"
"Anyway," Ginny went on, "he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black -"
"- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder," said Ron bitterly. "Fred and George's. I'm going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products."
"We tried everything, Lumos, Incendio," said Ginny. "Nothing would penetrate the darkness; all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us. Obviously Malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them, but we didn't dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other, and by the time we'd reached a corridor that was light, they'd gone."
"Luckily," said Lupin hoarsely, "Ron, Ginny, and Neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened. We found the Death Eaters minutes later, heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower. Malfoy obviously hadn't expected more people to be on the watch; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any rate. A fight broke out, they scattered and we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up the tower stairs -"
"To set off the Mark?" asked Harry.
"He must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement," said Lupin. "But I don't think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for Dumbledore, because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me."
"So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville," said Harry, turning to Hermione, "were you - ?"
"Outside Snape's office, yes," whispered Hermione, her eyes sparkling with tears, "with Luna. We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened. . . . We didn't know what was going on upstairs, Ron had taken the map-----It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I don't think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just burst his way into Snape's office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and - and -" "What?" Harry urged her.
"I was so stupid, Harry!" said Hermione in a high-pitched whisper. "He said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he - while he went to help fight the Death Eaters -" She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers, so that her voice was muffled. "We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor. . . and oh, it's so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didn't realize, Harry, we didn't realize, we just let Snape go!"
"It's not your fault," said Lupin firmly. "Hermione, had you not obeyed Snape and got out of the way, he probably would have killed you and Luna."
"So then he came upstairs," said Harry, who was watching Snape running up the marble staircase in his mind's eye, his black robes billowing behind him as ever, pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended, "and he found the place where you were all fighting. ..."
"We were in trouble, we were losing," said Tonks in a low voice. "Gibbon was down, but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death. Neville had been hurt, Bill had been savaged by Greyback... It was all dark . . . curses flying everywhere . . . The Malfoy boy had vanished, he must have slipped past, up the stairs . . . then more of them ran after him, but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse. . . . Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air -"
"None of us could break through," said Ron, "and that massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us. . . ."
"And then Snape was there," said Tonks, "and then he wasn't -"
"I saw him running toward us, but that huge Death Eaters jinx just missed me right afterward and I ducked and lost track of things," said Ginny.
"I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn't there," said Lupin. "I tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like Neville. . . ."
"He must have known a spell we didn't," whispered McGonagall. "After all - he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. ... I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who'd escaped up to the tower. ..."
"He was," said Harry savagely, "but to help them, not to stop them . . . and I'll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier - so what happened when he came back down?"
"Well, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in, and also broke the curse blocking the stairs," said Lupin. "We all ran forward - those of us who were still standing anyway - and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the dust - obviously, none of us attacked them -"
"We just let them pass," said Tonks in a hollow voice. "We thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters - and next thing, the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and we were fighting again - I thought I heard Snape shout something, but I don't know what -"
"He shouted, 'It's over,'" said Harry. "He'd done what he'd meant to do."
They all fell silent. Fawkes's lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside. As the music reverberated upon the air, unbidden, unwelcome thoughts slunk into Harry's mind. . . . Had they taken Dumbledore's body from the foot of the tower yet? What would happen to it next? Where would it rest? He clenched his fists tighdy in his pockets. He could feel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand.
The doors of the hospital wing burst open, making them all jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were striding up the ward, Fleur just behind them, her beautiful face terrified.
"Molly - Arthur -" said Professor McGonagall, jumping up and hurrying to greet them. "I am so sorry -"
"Bill," whispered Mrs. Weasley, darting past Professor McGonagall as she caught sight of Bill's mangled face. "Oh, Bill!"
Lupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could get nearer to the bed. Mrs. Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead.
"You said Greyback attacked him?" Mr. Weasley asked Professor McGonagall distractedly. "But he hadn't transformed? So what does that mean? What will happen to Bill?"
"We don't yet know," said Professor McGonagall, looking helplessly at Lupin.
"There will probably be some contamination, Arthur," .said Lupin. "It is an odd case, possibly unique. . . . We don't know what his behavior might be like when he awakens. . . ."
Mrs. Weasley took the nasty-smelling ointment from Madam Pomfrey and began dabbing at Bill's wounds.
"And Dumbledore ..." said Mr. Weasley. "Minerva, is it true ... Is he really. . . ?"
As Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny move beside him and looked at her. Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face.
"Dumbledore gone," whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley had eyes only for her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling onto Bill's mutilated face.
"Of course, it doesn't matter how he looks. . . . It's not r-really important. . . but he was a very handsome little b-boy . . . always very handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married!"
"And what do you mean by zat?" said Fleur suddenly and loudly. "What do you mean, ' he was going to be married?'"
Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled. "Well -only that-"
"You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore?" demanded Fleur. "You theenk, because of these bites, he will not love me?"
"No, that's not what I -"
"Because 'e will!" said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair. "It would take more zan a werewolf to stop Bill loving me!"
"Well, yes, I'm sure," said Mrs. Weasley, "but I thought perhaps - given how - how he -"
"You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per'aps, you hoped?" said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. "What do I care how he looks? I am good-looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave! And I shall do zat!" she added fiercely, pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her.
Mrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping up Bill's wounds with a most curious expression upon her face. Nobody said anything; Harry did not dare move. Like everybody else, he was waiting for the explosion.
"Our Great-Auntie Muriel," said Mrs. Weasley after a long pause, "has a very beautiful tiara - goblin-made - which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding. She is very fond of Bill, you know, and it would look lovely with your hair."
"Thank you," said Fleur stiffly. "I am sure zat will be lovely."
And then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, both , women were crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks.
"You see!" said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. "She still wants to marry him, even though he's been bitten! She doesn't care!
"It's different," said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense. "Bill will not be a full werewolf. The cases are completely -"
"But I don't care either, I don't care!" said Tonks, seizing the front of Lupin's robes and shaking them. "I've told you a million times. . . ."
And the meaning of Tonks's Patronus and her mouse-colored hair, and the reason she had come running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by Greyback, all suddenly became clear to Harry; it had not been Sinus that Tonks had fallen in love with after all.
"And I've told you a million times," said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, "that I am too old for you, too poor . . . too dangerous. . . ."
"I've said all along you're taking a ridiculous line on this, Remus," said Mrs. Weasley over Fleur's shoulder as she patted her on the back.
"I am not being ridiculous," said Lupin steadily. "Tonks deserves somebody young and whole."
"But she wants you," said Mr. Weasley, with a small smile. "And after all, Remus, young and whole men do not necessarily remain so."
He gestured sadly at his son, lying between them.
"This is... not the moment to discuss it," said Lupin, avoiding everybody's eyes as he looked around distractedly. "Dumbledore is dead. ..."
"Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world," said Professor McGonagall curtly, just as the hospital doors opened again and Hagrid walked in.
The little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen; he was shaking with tears, a vast, spotted handkerchief in his hand.
"I've . . . I've done it, Professor," he choked. "M-moved him. Professor Sprout's got the kids back in bed. Professor Flitwick's lyin down, but he says he'll be all righ' in a jiffy, an' Professor Slughorn says the Ministry's bin informed."
"Thank you, Hagrid," said Professor McGonagall, standing up at once and turning to look at the group around Bill's bed. "I shall have to see the Ministry when they get here. Hagrid, please tell the Heads of Houses - Slughorn can represent Slytherin - that I want to see them in my office forthwith. I would like you to join us too."
As Hagrid nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the room again, she looked down at Harry. "Before I meet them I would like a quick word with you, Harry. If you'll come with me. ..."
Harry stood up, murmured "See you in a bit" to Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, and followed Professor McGonagall back down the ward. The corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song. It was several minutes before Harry became aware that they were not heading for Professor McGonagall's office, but for Dumbledore's, and another few seconds before he realized that of course, she had been deputy headmistress, . . . Apparently she was now headmistress ... so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers.
In silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office. He did not know what he had expected: that the room would be draped in black, perhaps, or even that Dumbledore's body might be lying there. In fact, it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and Dumbledore had left it mere hours previously: the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle legged tables, Gryffindor's sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk, the Fawkes's perch stood empty, he was still crying his lament to the grounds. And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts: Dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk, his half-moon spectacle perched upon his crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled.
After glancing once at this portrait, Professor McGonagall made an odd movement as though steeling herself, then rounded the' desk to look at Harry, her face taut and lined.
"Harry," she said, "I would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school."
"I can't tell you that, Professor," said Harry. He had expected the question and had his answer ready. It had been here, in this very room, that Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione.
"Harry, it might be important," said Professor McGonagall.
"It is," said Harry, "very, but he didn't want me to tell anyone."
Professor McGonagall glared at him. "Potter" - Harry registered the renewed use of his surname - "in the light of Professor Dumbledore's death, I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat -"
"I don't think so," said Harry, shrugging. "Professor Dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders if he died." But -
"There's one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here, though. Madam Rosmerta's under the Imperius Curse, she was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters, that's how the necklace and the poisoned mead -"
"Rosmerta?" said Professor McGonagall incredulously, but before she could go on, there was a knock on the door behind them and Professors Sprout, Flitwick, and Slughorn traipsed into the room, followed by Hagrid, who was still weeping copiously, his huge frame trembling with grief.
"Snape!" ejaculated Slughorn, who looked the most shaken, pale and sweating. "Snape! I taught him! I thought I knew him!"
But before any of them could respond to this, a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall: A sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas. "Minerva, the Minister will be here within seconds, he has just Disapparated from the Ministry."
"Thank you, Everard," said Professor McGonagall, and she turned quickly to her teachers.
"I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here," she said quickly. "Personally, I am not convinced that the school should reopen next year. The death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts's history. It is horrible."
"I am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open," said Professor Sprout. "I feel that if a single pupil wants to come, then the school ought to remain open for that pupil."
"But will we have a single pupil after this?" said Slughorn, now dabbing his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief. "Parents will want to keep their children at home and I can't say I blame them. Personally, I don't think we're in more danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else, but you can't expect mothers to think like that. They'll want to keep their families together, it's only natural."
"I agree," said Professor McGonagall. "And in any case, it is not true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close. When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school - and I must say that Professor Dumbledore's murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherin's monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle. . . ."
"We must consult the governors," said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice; he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Snape's office. "We must follow the established procedures. A decision should not be made hastily."
"Hagrid, you haven't said anything," said Professor McGonagall. "What are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open?"
Hagrid, who had been weeping silently into his large, spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation, now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, "I dunno, Professor . . . that's fer the Heads of House an the headmistress ter decide ..."
"Professor Dumbledore always valued your views," said Professor McGonagall kindly, "and so do I."
"Well, I'm stayin," said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard. "It's me home, it's bin me home since I was thirteen. An' if there's kids who wan' me ter teach 'em, I'll do it. But... I dunno ... Hogwarts without Dumbledore .. ." He gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more, and there was silence.
"Very well," said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at the grounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching, "then I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors, who will make the final decision.
"Now, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later. We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary -"
"What about Dumbledore's funeral?" said Harry, speaking at last.
"Well. . ." said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook. "I - I know that it was Dumbledore's wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts -"
"Then that's what'll happen, isn't it?" said Harry fiercely.
"If the Ministry thinks it appropriate," said Professor McGonagall. "No other headmaster or headmistress has ever been -"
"No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school," growled Hagrid.
"Hogwarts should be Dumbledore's final resting place," said Professor Flitwick.
"Absolutely," said Professor Sprout.
"And in that case," said Harry, "you shouldn't send the students home until the jfuneral's over. They'll want to say -"
The last word caught in his throat, but Professor Sprout completed the sentence for him. "Good-bye."
"Well said," squeaked Professor Flitwick. "Well said indeed! Our students should pay tribute, it is fitting. We can arrange transport home afterward."
"Seconded," barked Professor Sprout. ]
"I suppose ... yes .. ." said Slughorn in a rather agitated voice, while Hagrid let out a strangled sob of assent.
"He's coming," said Professor McGonagall suddenly, gazing down into the grounds. "The Minister . . . and by the looks of it. he's brought a delegation . . ."
"Can I leave, Professor?" said Harry at once.
He had no desire at all to see, or be interrogated by, Rufus Scrimgeour tonight.
"You may," said Professor McGonagall. "And quickly."
She strode toward the door and held it open for him. He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor; he-had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower, but it did not matter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, not even Filch, Mrs. Norris, or Peeves. He did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Gryffindor common room.
"Is it true?" whispered the Fat Lady as he approached her. "It is really true? Dumbledore - dead?"
"Yes," said Harry.
She let out a wail and, without waiting for the password, swung forward to admit him.
As Harry had suspected it would be, the common room was jam-packed. The room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole. He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in a group nearby: This meant that the dormitory must be empty, or nearly so. Without speaking to anybody, without making eye contact at all, Harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys' dormitories.
As he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully dressed, sitting on his bed. Harry sat down on his own four-poster and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.
"They're talking about closing the school," said Harry.
"Lupin said they would," said Ron.
There was a pause.
"So?" said Ron in a very low voice, as though he thought the furniture might be listening in. "Did you find one? Did you get it? A - a Horcrux?"
Harry shook his head. All that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now; had it really happened, and only hours ago?
"You didn't get it?" said Ron, looking crestfallen. "It wasn't there?"
"No," said Harry. "Someone had already taken it and left a fake in its place."
"Already taken - ?"
Wordlessly, Harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket, opened it, and passed it to Ron. The full story could wait. ... It did not matter tonight. . . nothing mattered except the end, the end of their pointless adventure, the end of Dumbledore's life. . . .
"R.A.B.," whispered Ron, "but who was that?"
"Dunno," said Harry, lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards. He felt no curiosity at all about R.A.B.: He doubted that he would ever feel curious again. As he lay there, he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent. Fawkes had stopped singing. And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that ilie phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Harry.

  

Chapter 30: The White Tomb
All lessons were suspended, all examinations postponed. Some students were hurried away from Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of days - the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following Dumbledore's death and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his haughty-looking father. Seamus Finnigan, on the other hand, refused point-blank to accompany his mother home; they had a shouting match in the Entrance Hall which was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral. She had difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told Harry and Ron, for wizards and witches were pouring into the village, preparing to pay their last respects to Durnbledore. 
Some excitement was caused among the younger students, who had never seen it before, when a powder-blue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a dozen giant winged palo-minos, came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the Forest. Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting Hagrid's arms. Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials, including the Minister for Magic himself, was being accommodated within the castle. Harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; he 
was sure that, sooner or later, he would be asked again to account for Dumbledore's last excursion from Hogwarts. 
Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny were spending all of their time together. The beautiful weather seemed to mock them; Harry could imagine how it would have been if Durnbledore had not died, and they had had this time together at the very end of the year, Ginny's examinations finished, the pressure of homework lifted ... and hour by hour, he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say, doing what he knew it was right to do, because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort. 
They visited the hospital wing twice a day: Neville had been discharged, but Bill remained under Madam Pomfrey's care. His scars were as bad as ever; in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs, but in personality he seemed jusi the same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks. 
'... so eet ees lucky 'e is marrying me,' said Fleur happily, plumping up Bill's pillows, 'because ze British overcook their meat, I 'ave always said this.' 
'I suppose I'm just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her,' sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron and Hermione sat beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over the twilit grounds, 
'She's not that bad,' said Harry. 'Ugly, though,' he added hastily, as Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle. 
'Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, 1 can.' 
'Anyone else we know died?' Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the Evening Prophet. 
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice. 
'No,' she said reprovingly, folding up ihe newspaper. 'They're still looking for Snape, but no sign ...' 
'Of course there isn't,' said Harry, who became angry every lime this subject cropped up. They won't find Snape till they find Voldemort, and seeing as they've never managed to do that in all this time ...' 
'I'm going to go to bed,' yawned Ginny. 'I haven't been sleeping thai well since ... well ... I could do with some sleep.' 
She kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved al the other two and departed for the girls' dormitories. The moment the door had closed behind her, Hermione leaned forwards towards Harry with a most Hermione-ish look on her face. 
'Harry, I found something ou( this morning, in the library ..,' 
'R.A.B.?' said Harry, silling up straight. 
He did not feel the way he had so often felt before, excited, curious, burning to get to the bottom of a mystery; he simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little further along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him, the path that he and Dumbledore had set out upon together, and which he now knew he would have to journey alone. There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there somewhere and each would need to be found and elim-inated before there was even a possibility that Voldemort could be killed. He kept reciting their names to himself, as though by listing them he could bring them within reach: 'the locket .., the cup ... the snake ... something of Gryffindor's or Ravenclaw's ... the locket ... the cup ... the snake ... something of Gryffindor's or Ravenclaw's ...' 
This mantra seemed to pulse through Harry's mind as he 
fell asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with cups, lockets and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach, though Dumbledore helpfully offered Harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb ... 
He had shown Hermione the note inside the locket the morning after Dumbledore's death, and although she had not immediately recognised the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading, she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do. 
'No,' she said sadly, 'I've been trying, Harry, but I haven't found anything ... there are a couple of reasonably well-known wizards with those initials - Rosalind Antigone Bungs ... Rupert "Axebanger" Brookstanton ... but they don't seem to fit at all. Judging by that note, the person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort, and I can't find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him ... no, actually, it's about ... well, Snape.' 
She looked nervous even saying the name again. 
'What about him?' asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his chair. 
'Well, it's just that I was sort of right about the Half-Blood Prince business,' she said tentatively. 
'D'you have to rub it in, Hermione? How tTyou think 1 feel about that now?' 
'No - no - Harry, I didn't mean that!' she said hastily, look-ing around to check that they were not being overheard. 'It's just that 1 was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see ... she was Snape's mother!' 
T thought she wasn't much of a looker,' said Ron. Hermione ignored him. 
'1 was going through ihe rest of the old Prophets and there 
was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and then later an announcement saying that she'd given birth to a -' 
'- murderer,' spat Harry. 
'Well ... yes,' said Hermione. 'So ... 1 was sort of right. Snape must have been proud of being "half a Prince", you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggie from what it said in the Prophet' 
'Yeah, that fits,' said Harry. 'He'd play up the pure-blood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them ... he's just like Voldemort. Pure-blood mother, Muggie father ... ashamed of his parentage, trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name - Lard Voldemort - the Half-Blood Prince - how could Dumbledore have missed -?' 
He broke off, looking out of the window. He could not stop himself dwelling upon Dumbledore's inexcusable trust in Snape ... but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same ... in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so much ... 
Helped him ... it was an almost unendurable thought, now ... 
'I still don't get why he didn't turn you in for using that book,' said Ron. 'He must've known where you were getting it ali from.' 
'He knew,' said Harry bitterly. 'He knew when I used Secfumsempra. He didn't really need Legilimency ... he might even have known before then, with Slughom talking about how brilliant I was at Potions ... shouldn't have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard, should he?' 
'But why didn't he turn you in?' 
'I don't ihink he wanted to associate himself with that book,' said Hermione. 'I don't think Dumbledore would have liked it very much if he'd known. And even if Snape pre-tended it hadn't been his, Slughom would have recognised his writing at once. Anyway, the book was left in Snape's old classroom, and I'll bet Dumbledore knew his mother was called "Prince".' 
T should've shown the book to Dumbledore,' said Harry. 'All that lime he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school, and 1 had proof Snape was, too -' 
'"Evil" is a strong word,' said Hermione quietly. 
'You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous!' 
'I'm trying to say, Harry, that you're pulling too much blame on yourself. 1 thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humour, but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer ...' 
'None of us could've guessed Snape would ... you know,' said Ron. 
Silence fell between them, each of them lost in their own thoughts, but Harry was sure that they, like him, were think-ing about the following morning, when Dumbledore's body would be laid to rest. Harry had never attended a funeral before; there had been no body to bury when Sirius had died. He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see, about how he would feel. He won-dered whether Dumbledore's death would be more real to him once the funeral was over. Though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him, there were blank stretches of numbness where, despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle, he still found it difficult 10 believe that Dumbledore 
had really gone. Admittedly he had not, as he had with Sirius, looked desperately for some kind of loophole, some way that Dumbledore would come back ... he felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake Horcrux, which he now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do. 
Harry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts Express would be leaving an hour after the funeral. Down-stairs he found the mood in the Great Hall subdued. Every-body was wearing their dress robes and no one seemed very hungry. Professor McGonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty. Hagrid's chair was des-erted too: Harry thought thai perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast; but Snape's place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for him. Among Scrimgeour's entourage Harry spotted the red hair and horn-rimmed glasses of Percy Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy, apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom. 
Over at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were mutter-
ing together. Hulking boys though they were, they looked
oddly lonely without the tall, pale figure of Malfoy between
them, bossing them around. Harry had not spared Malfoy
much thought. His animosity was all for Snape, but he had
not forgotten the fear in Malfoy's voice on that Tower top, nor
the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death
Eaters arrived. Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have
killed Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still for his infatu-
ation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of pity
mingled with his dislike. Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy
now, and what was Voldemort making him do under threat of
killing him and his parents? ? ???>. 
Harry's thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from Ginny. Professor McGonagall had risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the Hall died away at once. 
'It is nearly time,' she said. 'Please follow your Heads of House out into the grounds. Gryffindors, after me.' 
They filed out from behind their benches in near silence. Harry glimpsed Slughorn at the head of the Slytherin column, wearing magnificent long emerald-green robes embroidered with silver. He had never seen Professor Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, looking so clean; there was not a single patch on her hat, and when they reached the Entrance Hall, they found Madam Pince standing beside Filch, she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an ancient black suit and tie reek-ing of mothbails. 
They were heading, as Harry saw when he stepped out on to the stone steps from the front doors, towards the lake. The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. An aisle ran down the centre of them: there was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs facing it. It was the most beautiful summer's day. 
An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs: shabby and smart, old and young. Most Harry did not recognise, but there were a few that he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt, Mad-Eye Moody, Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink, Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands, Mr and Mrs Weasley, Bill sup-ported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragonskin. Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two-and-a-half chairs on her own, Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron, Arabella Figg, Harry's Squib neighbour, the hairy bass player from the 
wizardmg group the Weird bisters, hrnie Frang, dnver ol the Knight Bus, Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley, and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog's Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially in the gleaming air. 
Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake. People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna. They alone of all the DA had responded to Hermione's summons the night that Dumbledore had died, and Harry knew why: they were the ones who had missed the DA most ... probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting ... 
Cornelius Fudge walked past them towards the front rows, his expression miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next recognised Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuri-ated to see, had a notebook clutched in her red-takmed hand; and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-coloured curls. At the sight of the centaur Firenze, who was standing like a sentinel near the water's edge, she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away. 
The staff were seated at last. Harry could see Scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with Professor McGonagall. He wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that Dumbledore wasand he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it. He was not the only one: many heads were turning, searching, a little alarmed. 
'In there,' whispered Ginny in Harry's ear. 
And he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, inches below the surface, reminding him horribly of the Inferi; a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand, their pallid faces rippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them. The music made the hair on Harry's neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. As he looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they, at least, were sorry for Dumbledore's passing. Then Ginny nudged him again and he looked round. 
Hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs. He was crying quite silently, his face gleaming with tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what Harry knew to be Dumbledore's body. A sharp pain rose in Harry's throat at this sight: for a moment, the strange music and the knowledge that Dumbledore's body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day. Ron looked white and shocked. Tears were falling thick and fast into both Ginny and Hermione's laps. 
They could not see clearly what was happening at the front. Hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table. Now he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some, including, Harry saw, Dolores Umbridge ... but Harry knew that Dumbledore would not have cared. He tried to make a friendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagrid's eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going. Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid 
was heading and realised what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small mar-quee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulder-like head bowed, docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to his half-brother and Grawp palled Hagrid hard on the head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground. Harry had a wonder-ful momentary urge to laugh. But then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again. 
A little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of Dumbledore's body. Harry could not hear what he was saying. Odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of beads. 'Nobility of spirit' ... 'intel-lectual contribution' ... 'greatness of heart' ... it did not mean very much. It had little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had known him. He suddenly remembered Dumbledore's idea of a few words: 'nitwit', 'oddment', 'blubber' and 'tweak 1, and again, had to suppress a grin ... what was the matter with him? 
There was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen, too. He remembered Dumbledore crouching at the water's edge two years ago, very close to where Harry now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess. Harry wondered where Dumbledore had learned Mermish. There was so much he had never asked him, so much he should have said ... 
And then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth, more completely and undeniably than it had until now. Dumbledore was dead, gone ... he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: he looked away from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake, towards the Forest, as the little man in black droned on ... there was movement among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects, too. They did not move into the open but Harry saw them 
standing quite still, half-hidden in shadow, watching the wiz-ards, their bows hanging at their sides. And Harry remem-bered his first nightmarish trip into the Forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated ... 
And Harry saw very clearly as be sal there under the hot sun bow people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon for ever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one: that the shelter of a parent's arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his proteclors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before. 
The little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat. Harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved. 
Then several people screamed. Bright, white flames had erupted around Dumbledore's body and the table upon which it lay: higher and higher they rose, obscuring the body. White smoke spiralled into the air and made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heart-stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing Dumbledore's body and the table on which he had rested. 
There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air, but they fell far short of the crowd. It was, Harry knew, the centaurs' tribute: he saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees. Likewise the mer-people sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view. 
Harry looked ai Ginny, Ron and Hermione: Ron's face was screwed up as though the sunlight was blinding him. Hermione's face was glazed with tears, but Ginny was no longer crying. She met Harry's gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say 'Be careful', or 'Don't do it', but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since Dumbledore had died. 
'Ginny, listen ...' he said very quietly, as the buzz of con-versation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet. 'I can't be involved with you any more. We've got to stop seeing each other. We can't be together.' 
She said, with an oddly twisted smile, 'It's for some stupid, noble reason, isn't it?' 
'It's been like ... like something out of someone else's life, these last few weeks with you,' said Harry. 'But 1 can't ... we can't ... I've got things to do alone now.' 
She did not cry, she simply looked at him, 
'Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He's already used you as bait once, and that was just because you're my best friend's sister. Think how much danger you'll be in if we keep this up. He'll know, he'll find out. He'll try and get to me through you.' 
'What if I don't care?' said Ginny fiercely. 
'I care,' said Harry. 'How do you think I'd feel if this was your funeral ... and it was my fault ...' 
She looked away from him, over the lake. 
T never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' 
'Smart girl, that Hermione,' said Harry, trying to smile. 'I just wish I'd asked you sooner. We coukTve had ages ... months ... years maybe ...' 
'But you've been too busy saving the wizarding world,' said Ginny, half-laughing. 'Well ... I can't say I'm surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that's why I like you so much.' 
Harry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her. Ron, he saw, was now holding Hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long nose. With a miserable gesture, Harry got up, turned his back on Ginny and on Dumbledore's tomb and walked away around the lake. Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still: just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it ... 
'Harry!' 
He turned. Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly towards him around the bank, leaning on his walking stick. 
'I've been hoping to have a word ... do you mind if I walk a little way with you?' 
'No,' said Harry indifferently, and set off again. 
'Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy,' said Scrimgeour quietly, 'I cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear of it. Dumbledore was a very great wizard. We had our disagree-ments, as you know, but no one knows better than 1 -' 
?What do you want?' asked Harry flatly. 
Scrimgeour looked annoyed but, as before, hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding. 
'You are, of course, devastated,' he said. 'I know that you were very close to Dumbledore. I think you may have been his favourite ever pupil. The bond between the two of you -' 
'What do you want?' Harry repeated, coming to a halt. 
Scrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick and stared at Harry, his expression shrewd now. 
'The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died.' 
'Whose word?' said Harry. 
'Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the Tower after Dumbledore died. There were also two broomsticks up there. The Ministry can add two and two, Harry.' 
'Glad to hear it,' said Harry. 'Well, where I went with Dumbledore and what we did is my business. He didn't want people to know.' 
'Such loyalty is admirable, of course,' said Scrimgeour, who seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty, 'bul Dumbledore is gone, Harry. He's gone.' 
'He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him,' said Harry, smiling in spite of himself. 
'My dear boy ... even Dumbledore cannot return from the-' 
'I am not saying he can. You wouldn't understand. But I've got nothing to tell you.' 
Scrimgeour hesitated, then said, in what was evidently 
supposed to be a tone of delicacy, The Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection, you know, Harry. I would be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at your service -' 
Harry laughed. 
'Voldemort wants to kill me himself and Aurors won't stop him. So thanks for the offer, but no thanks.' 
'So,' said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, 'the request 1 made of you at Christmas -' 
'What request? Oh yeah ... the one where I tell the world what a great job you're doing in exchange for ' 
'- for raising everyone's morale!' snapped Scrimgeour. 
Harry considered him for a moment. 
'Released Stan Shunpike yet?' 
Scrimgeour turned a nasty purple colour highly remin-iscent of Uncle Vernon. 
'1 see you are -' 
'Dumbledore's man through and through,' said Harry. 'That's right.' 
Scrimgeour glared at him for another moment, then turned and limped away without another word. Harry could see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for him, casting nervous glances at the sobbing Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their seats. Ron and Hermione were hurry-ing towards Harry, passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite direction; Harry turned and walked slowly on, waiting for them to catch up, which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier times. 
"What did Scrimgeour want?' Hermione whispered. 
'Same as he wanted at Christmas,' shrugged Harry. 'Wanted me to give him inside information on Dumbledore and be the Ministry's new poster boy.' 
Ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, then he said loudly to Hermione, 'Look, let me go back and hit Percy!' 
'No,' she said firmly, grabbing his arm. 
'It'll make me feel better!' 
Harry laughed. Even Hermione grinned a little, though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle. 
'I can't bear the idea that we might never come back.' she said softly. 'How can Hogwarts close?' 
'Maybe it won't,' said Ron. 'We're not in any more danger here than we are at home, are we? Everywhere's the same now. I'd even say Hogwarts is safer, there are more wizards inside to defend the place. What d'you reckon, Harry?' 
'I'm not coming back even if it does reopen,' said Harry. 
Ron gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, 'I knew you were going to say that. But then what will you do? 1 
'I'm going back to the Dursleys' once more, because Dumbledore wanted me to,' said Harry. 'But it'll be a short visit, and then I'll be gone for good.' 
'But where will you go if you don't come back to school?' 
'I thought I might go back to Godric's Hollow,' Harry mut-tered. He had had the idea in his head ever since the night of Dumbledore's death. 'For me, it started there, all of it. I've just got a feeling I need to go there. And I can visit my parents' graves, I'd like that.' 
'And then what?' said Ron. 
Then I've got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, haven't I?' said Harry, his eyes upon Dumbledore's white tomb, reflected in the water on the other side of the lake. That's what he wanted me to do, that's why he told me all about them. If Dumbledore was right - and I'm sure he was -there are still four of them out there. I've got to find them and destroy them and then I've got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemort's soul, the bit that's still in his body, and I'm the one who's going to kill him. And if I meet Severus Snape 
along the way,' he added, 'so much trie better tor me, so mucn the worse for him.' 
There was a long silence. The crowd had almost dispersed now, the stragglers giving the monumental figure of Grawp a wide berth as he cuddled Hagrid, whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water. 
'We'll be there, Harry,' said Ron. 
'What?' 
At your aunt and uncle's house,' said Ron. 'And then we'll go with you, wherever you're going.' 
'No -' said Harry quickly; he had not counted on this, he had meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone. 
'You said to us once before,' said Hermione quietly, 'that there was time to turn back if we wanted to. We've had time, haven't we?' 
'We're with you whatever happens,' said Ron. 'But, mate, you're going to have to come round my mum and dad's house before we do anything else, even Godric's Hollow.' 
'Why?' 
'Bill and Fleur's wedding, remember?' 
Harry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful. 
'Yeah, we shouldn't miss that,' he said finally. 
His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meet-ing with Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 
By J. K. Rowling 


 Chapter One 
The Dark Lord Ascending 


The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit 
lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other's chests; then, 
recognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking 
briskly in the same direction. 
"News?" asked the taller of the two. 
"The best," replied Severus Snape. 
The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, 
neatly manicured hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they 
marched. 
"Thought I might be late," said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as 
the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. "It was a little trickier than I 
expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be 
good?" 
Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led 
off the lane. The high hedge curved into them, running off into the distance beyond the 
pair of imposing wrought-iron gates barring the mens way. Neither of them broke step: 
In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as 
though the dark metal was smoke. 

 The yew hedges muffled the sound of the mens footsteps. There was a rustle 
somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companions 
head, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, 
strutting majestically along the top of the hedge. 

 He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks  Yaxley thrust his wand back 
under his cloak with a snort. 

 A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, 
lights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden 
beyond the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and 
Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though 
nobody had visibly opened it. 

 The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent 
carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the wall 
followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden 
door leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned 
the bronze handle. 

 The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The 
rooms usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination 
came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded 
mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew 
accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the 
scene: an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, 
revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in 
the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people seated underneath this 


singular sight were looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below 
it. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so. 

 Yaxley. Snape, said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. You are 
very nearly late. 

 The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at 
first, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they drew nearer, 
however, his face shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and 
gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a 
pearly glow. 

 Severus, here, said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate right. 
Yaxley C beside Dolohov. 

 The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table 
followed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first. 

 So? 

 My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current 
place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall. 

 The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, 
all gazing at Snape and Voldemort. 

 Saturday  at nightfall, repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon 
Snapes black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently 
fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, 
however, looked calmly back into Voldemorts face and, after a moment or two, 
Voldemorts lipless mouth curved into something like a smile. 

 Good. Very good. And this information comes C 

  C from the source we discussed, said Snape. 

 My Lord. 

 Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. 
All faces turned to him. 

 My Lord, I have heard differently. 

 Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, Dawlish, the Auror, 
let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns 
seventeen. 

 Snape was smiling. 

 My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No 
doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; 
he is known to be susceptible. 

 I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain, said Yaxley. 

 If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain, said Snape. I assure you, 
Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The 
Order believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry. 

 The Orders got one thing right, then, eh? said a squat man sitting a short 
distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the 
table. 

 Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving 
slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought. 


 My Lord, Yaxley went on, Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be 
used to transfer the boy C 

 Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching 
resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape. 

 Where are they going to hide the boy next? 

 At the home of one of the Order, said Snape. The place, according to the 
source, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could 
provide. I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, 
of course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the 
opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest. 

 Well, Yaxley? Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely 
in his red eyes. Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday? 

 Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders. 

 My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have C with difficulty, and after great 
effort C succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse. 

 Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a 
man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back. 

 It is a start, said Voldemort. But Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must 
be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Ministers life will 
set me back a long way. 

 Yes C my Lord, that is true C but you know, as Head of the Department of 
Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister 
himself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be 
easy now that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to subjugate the 
others, and then they can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down. 

 As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the 
rest, said Voldemort. At any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine 
before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done 
while he travels. 

 We are at an advantage there, my Lord, said Yaxley, who seemed determined to 
receive some portion of approval. We now have several people planted within the 
Department of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall 
know immediately. 

 He will not do either, said Snape. The Order is eschewing any form of 
transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do 
with the place. 

 All the better, said Voldemort. He will have to move in the open. Easier to 
take, by far. 

 Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, I shall 
attend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is 
concerned. Some of them have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors 
than to his triumphs. 

 The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, 
by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potters continued 
existence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of 
them, still addressing the unconscious body above him. 


 I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those 
wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those things 
that I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be. 

 At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail sounded, a terrible, 
drawn-out cry of misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked downward, startled, 
for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet. 

 Wormtail, said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet, thoughtful tone, and 
without removing his eyes from the revolving body above, have I not spoken to you 
about keeping our prisoner quiet? 

 Yes, m-my Lord, gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been 
sitting so low in his chair that it appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he 
scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a 
curious gleam of silver. 

 As I was saying, continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces of his 
followers, I understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a wand from one 
of you before I go to kill Potter. 

 The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have announced that 
he wanted to borrow one of their arms. 

 No volunteers? said Voldemort. Lets see  Lucius, I see no reason for you to 
have a wand anymore. 

 Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight, 
and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse. 

 My Lord? 

 Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand. 

 I  

 Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight ahead, quite as pale 
as he was, her long blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the table her slim 
fingers closed briefly on his wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, 
withdrew a wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, who held it up in front of his red 
eyes, examining it closely. 

 What is it? 

 Elm, my Lord, whispered Malfoy. 

 And the core? 

 Dragon C dragon heartstring. 

 Good, said Voldemort. He drew out his wand and compared the lengths. Lucius 
Malfoy made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected 
to receive Voldemorts wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by 
Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously. 

 Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand? 

 Some of the throng sniggered. 

 I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have 
noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late  What is it about my 
presence in your home that displaces you, Lucius? 

 Nothing C nothing, my Lord! 

 Such lies Lucius   


 The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving. 
One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder; 
something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table. 

 The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemorts chair. It rose, seemingly 
endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemorts shoulders: its neck the thickness of a 
mans thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked 
the creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy. 

 Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my rise to 
power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years? 

 Of course, my Lord, said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped sweat 
from his upper lip. We did desire it C we do. 

 To Malfoys left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from 
Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the 
inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye 
contact. 

 My Lord, said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice constricted with 
emotion, it is an honor to have you here, in our familys house. There can be no higher 
pleasure. 

 She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and heavily 
lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, 
Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for 
closeness. 

 No higher pleasure, repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little to one side as he 
considered Bellatrix. That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you. 

 Her face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of delight. 

 My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth! 

 No higher pleasure  even compared with the happy event that, I hear, has 
taken place in your family this week? 

 She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused. 

 I dont know what you mean, my Lord. 

 Im talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa. She has 
just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud. 

 There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many leaned 
forward to exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with their fists. The giant 
snake, disliking the disturbance, opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death 
Eaters did not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys humiliation. 
Bellatrixs face, so recently flushed wit happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red. 

 She is no niece of ours, my Lord, she cried over the outpouring of mirth. We C 
Narcissa and I C have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This 
brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries. 

 What say you, Draco? asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, it 
carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. Will you babysit the cubs? 

 The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, who was 
staring down into his own lap, then caught his mothers eye. She shook her head almost 
imperceptibly, then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall. 

 Enough, said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. Enough. 


 And the laughter died at once. 

 Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time, he said as 
Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring, You must prune yours, must you not, 
to keep it healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest. 

 Yes, my Lord, whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude 
again. At the first chance! 

 You shall have it, said Voldemort. And in your family, so in the world  we 
shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain  

 Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoys wand, pointed it directly at the slowly 
revolving figure suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny flick. The figure came to life 
with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds. 

 Do you recognize our guest, Severus? asked Voldemort. 

 Snape raised his eyes to the upside down face. All of the Death Eaters were 
looking up at the captive now, as though they had been given permission to show 
curiosity. As she revolved to face the firelight, the woman said in a cracked and terrified 
voice, Severus! Help me! 

 Ah, yes, said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again. 

 And you, Draco? asked Voldemort, stroking the snakes snout with his wand-
free hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that the woman had woken, he seemed 
unable to look at her anymore. 

 But you would not have taken her classes, said Voldemort. For those of you 
who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently, 
taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 

 There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad, hunched 
woman with pointed teeth cackled. 

 Yes  Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about 
Muggles  how they are not so different from us   

 One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape 
again. 

 Severus  please  please   

 Silence, said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoys wand, and Charity fell 
silent as if gagged. Not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding 
children, last week Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the 
Daily Prophet. Wizards, she says, must accept these thieves of their knowledge and 
magic. The dwindling of the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable 
circumstance  She would have us all mate with Muggles  or, no doubt, werewolves 
  

 Nobody laughed this time. There was no mistaking the anger and contempt in 
Voldemorts voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears 
were pouring from her eyes into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as 
she turned slowly away from him again. 

 Avada Kedavra 

 The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. Charity fell, with a 
resounding crash, onto the table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of the Death 
Eaters leapt back in their chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the floor. 


 Dinner, Nagini, said Voldemort softly, and the great snake swayed and slithered 
from his shoulders onto the polished wood. 

 

Chapter Two 

In Memorandum 

 

Harry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his 
breath, he shouldered open his bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking china. He 
had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom 
door. 

 "What the --?" 

 He looked around, the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted. 
Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley's idea of a clever booby trap. Keeping his bleeding 
hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw 
them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped 
across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap. 

 It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of 
being unable to perform magicbut he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his 
finger would have defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he 
came to think of it C particularly in light of his immediate plans C this seemed a serious 
flaw in his magical education. Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, 
he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before 
returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him. 

 Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first 
time since he had packed it six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, he 
had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or 
updated them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom C old quills, desiccated 
beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his 
hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, 
and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood. 

 He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the trunk again, 
he groped around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly 
between SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out 
Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he 
finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It 
was a two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had 
given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing 


more remained of his godfather's last gift except powdered glass, which clung to the 
deepest layer of debris like glittering grit. 

 Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself, seeing 
nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the fragment 
on top of that morning's Daily prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to 
stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret and of longing the 
discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the 
trunk. 

 It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the useless items, and 
sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on. 
His school and Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks 
were piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do 
with them; burn them in the dead of night, probably, as if they were evidence of some 
dreadful crime. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, certain books, 
the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters, and his wand had 
been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the Marauder's Map and the 
locket with the note signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this place of honor 
not because it was valuable C in all usual senses it was worthless C but because of what it 
had cost to attain it. 

 This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl, 
Hedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this summer. 

 He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk. Hedwig made no 
movement as he began to flick through newspapers, throwing them into the rubbish pile 
one by one. The owl was asleep or else faking; she was angry with Harry about the 
limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment. 

 As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down, searching 
for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to Privet 
Drive for the summer; he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front 
about the resignation of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At 
last he found it. Turning to page ten, he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he 
had been looking for. 

 

 ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED 

 By Elphias Doge 

I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our first day at Hogwarts. Our 
mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be 
outsiders. I had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and while 


I was no longer contagious, my pock-marked visage and greenish hue did not 
encourage many to approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts 
under the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father, 
Percival, had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three 
young Muggles. 

Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) had 
committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he 
assured me that he knew his father to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused 
to speak of the sad business, though many attempted to make him do so. Some, 
indeed, were disposed to praise his father's action and assumed that Albus too was 
a Muggle-hater. They could not have been more mistaken: As anybody who knew 
Albus would attest, he never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency. Indeed, 
his determined support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent 
years. 

In a matter of months, however, Albus's own fame had begun to eclipse that 
of his father. By the end of his first year he would never again be known as the 
son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student 
ever seen at the school. Those of us who were privileged to be his friends 
benefited from his example, not to mention his help and encouragement, with 
which he was always generous. He confessed to me later in life that he knew even 
then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching. 

He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in 
regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including 
Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; 
and Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found their 
way into learned publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in 
Charming, and The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore's future career seemed 
likely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was when he would 
become Minister of Magic. Though it was often predicted in later years that he 
was on the point of taking the job, however, he never had Ministerial ambitions. 

Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus's brother, Aberforth, 
arrived at school. They were not alike: Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike 
Albus, preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned 
discussion. However, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers 
were not friends. They rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys 
could do. In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that living in Albus's 
shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience. Being continually 
outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been 
any more pleasurable as a brother. When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended 
to take the then-traditional tour of the world together, visiting and observing 
foreign wizards, before pursuing our separate careers. However, tragedy 
intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus's mother, Kendra, died, leaving 


Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my departure 
long enough to pay my respects at Kendra's funeral, then left for what was now to 
be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold 
left to them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me. 

That was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I wrote to Albus, 
describing, perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow 
escapes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments of the Egyptian alchemists. 
His letters told me little of his day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly 
dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own experiences, it was with 
horror that I heard, toward the end of my year's travels, that another tragedy had 
struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, Ariana. 

Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow, coming so 
soon after the loss of their mother, had a profound effect on both of her brothers. 
All those closest to Albus C and I count myself one of that lucky number C agree 
that Ariana's death, and Albus's feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of 
course, he was guiltless), left their mark upon him forevermore. 

I returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older 
person's suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and much less light-
hearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana had led, not to a renewed 
closeness between Albus and Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this 
would lift C in later years they reestablished, if not a close relationship, then 
certainly a cordial one.) However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from 
then on, and his friends learned not to mention them. 

Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years. Dumbledore's 
innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including his 
discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, will benefit generations to come, 
as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments while Chief Warlock of 
the Wizengamot. They say, still, that no Wizarding duel ever matched that 
between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945. Those who witnessed it have 
written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary 
wizards to battle. Dumbledore's triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding 
world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction 
of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named. 

Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value 
in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his 
early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his 
friendship more than I can say, but my loss is nothing compared to the Wizarding 
world's. That he was the most inspiring and best loved of all Hogwarts 
headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived: working always for the 


greater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy 
with dragon pox as he was on the day I met him. 

 

 Harry finished reading, but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the 
obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered over the 
top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying 
Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation. 

 He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this 
obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never once 
had he imagined Dumbledore's childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into 
being as Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea of a 
teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a 
friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt. 

 He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No doubt it would have 
felt strange, impertinent even, but after all it had been common knowledge that 
Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not 
thought to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his other famous 
achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, Harry's past, Harry's future, Harry's 
plans and it seemed to Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and 
so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask 
Dumbledore more about himself, even though the only personal question he had ever 
asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not 
answered honestly: 

 "What do you see when you look in the mirror?" 

 "I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks." 

 After several minutes' thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded 
it carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and its 
Use against the Dark Arts. Then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile 
and turned to face the room. It was much tidier. The only things left out of place were 
today's Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror. 

 Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today's Prophet, and 
unfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the 
rolled-up paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting 
that it said nothing about Voldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the 
Prophet to suppress news about Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw what 
he had missed. 


 Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture 
of Dumbledore striding along, looking harried: 

 

 DUMBLEDORE C THE TRUTH AT LAST? 

Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many 
to be the greatest wizard of his generation. Striping away the popular image of 
serene, silver-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the 
lawless youth, the life-long feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried 
to his grave, WHY was the man tipped to be the Minister of Magic content to 
remain a mere headmaster? WHAT was the real purpose of the secret 
organization known as the Order of the Phoenix? HOW did Dumbledore really 
meet his end? 

 The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the 
explosive new biography, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, 
exclusively interviewed by Berry Braithwaite, page 13, inside. 

 

 Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article was topped with 
a picture showing another familiar face: a woman wearing jeweled glasses with 
elaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a 
winning smile, wiggling her fingers up at him. Doing his best to ignore this nauseating 
image, Harry read on. 

 

In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously 
ferocious quill-portraits might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her cozy 
home, she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake 
and, it goes without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip. 

"Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer's dream," says Skeeter. "Such a 
long, full life. I'm sure my book will be the first of very, very many." 

Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her nine-hundred-page book was 
completed in a mere four weeks after Dumbledore's mysterious death in June. I 
ask her how she managed this superfast feat. 

"Oh, when you've been a journalist as long as I have, working to a deadline is 
second nature. I knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for the full story 
and I wanted to be the first to meet that need." 


I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge, Special 
Advisor to the Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore's, that 
"Skeeter's book contains less fact than a Chocolate Frog card." 

Skeeter throws back her head and laughs. 

"Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him a few years back about 
merpeople rights, bless him. Completely gaga, seemed to think we were sitting at 
the bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me to watch out for trout." 

And yet Elphias Doge's accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many 
places. Does Skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a 
full picture of Dumbledore's long and extraordinary life? 

"Oh, my dear," beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately across the knuckles, 
"you know as well as I do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of 
Galleons, a refusal to hear the word 'no,' and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! 
People were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone 
thought he was so wonderful, you know C he trod on an awful lot of important 
toes. But old Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because I've had access 
to a source most journalists would swap their wands for, one who has never 
spoken in public before and who was close to Dumbledore during the most 
turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth." 

The advance publicity for Skeeter's biography has certainly suggested that 
there will be shocks in store for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a 
blameless life. What were the biggest surprises she uncovered, I ask? 

"Now, come off it. Betty, I'm not giving away all the highlights before 
anybody's bought the book!" laughs Skeeter. "But I can promise that anybody 
who still thinks Dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening! 
Let's just say that nobody hearing him rage against You-Know-Who would have 
dreamed that he dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard 
who spent his later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn't exactly broad-minded 
when he was younger! Yes, Albus Dumbledore had an extremely murky past, not 
to mention that very fishy family, which he worked so hard to keep hushed up." 

I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth, whose 
conviction by the Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen 
years ago. 

"Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap, laughs Skeeter. "No, no, I'm 
talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with 
goats, worse even than the Muggle-maiming father C Dumbledore couldn't keep 
either of them quiet anyway, they were both charged by the Wizengamot. No, it's 
the mother and the sister that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a 


positive nest of nastiness C but, as I say, you'll have to wait for chapters nine to 
twelve for full details. All I can say now is, it's no wonder Dumbledore never 
talked about how his nose got broken." 

Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter deny the brilliance that led to 
Dumbledore's many magical discoveries? 

"He had brains," she concedes, "although many now question whether he 
could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in 
chapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of 
dragon's blood when Dumbledore 'borrowed' his papers." 

But the importance of some of Dumbledore's achievements cannot, I venture, 
be denied. What of his famous defeat of Grindelwald? 

"Oh, now, I'm glad you mentioned Grindelwald," says Skeeter with such a 
tantalizing smile. "I'm afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore's 
spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell C or perhaps a 
Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. All I'll say is, don't be so sure that there 
really was a spectacular duel of legend. After they've read my book, people may 
be forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief 
from the end of his wand and came quietly!" 

Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject, so we turn 
instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than 
any other. 

"Oh yes," says Skeeter, nodding briskly, "I devote an entire chapter to the 
whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship. It's been called unhealthy, even sinister. 
Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story, but there is no 
question that Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go. 
Whether that was really in the boy's best interests C well, we'll see. It's certainly 
an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence." 

I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so 
famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke 
exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned. 

"Oh, yes, we've developed a closer bond," says Skeeter. "Poor Potter has few 
real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life C the 
Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only people alive who can say 
that they know the real Harry Potter." 

Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about Dumbledore's 
final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dumbledore died? 


"Well, I don't want to say too much C it's all in the book C but eyewitnesses 
inside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after 
Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed. Potter later gave evidence against 
Severus Snape, a man against whom he has a notorious grudge. Is everything as it 
seems? That is for the Wizarding community to decide C once they've read my 
book." 

On that intriguing note, I take my leave. There can be no doubt that Skeeter 
has quilled an instant bestseller. Dumbledore's legion of admirers, meanwhile, 
may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero. 

 

 Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at the page. 
Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the newspaper and threw it, with 
all his force, at the wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his 
overflowing bin. 

 He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking 
up books only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, 
as random phrases from Rita's article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole 
Potter-Dumbledore relationship ... It's been called unhealthy, even sinister ... He dabbled 
in the Dark Arts himself in his youth ... I've had access to a source most journalists would 
swap their wands for... 

 "Lies!" Harry bellowed, and through the window he saw the next-door neighbor, 
who had paused to restart his lawn mower, look up nervously. 

 Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced away from him; 
he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers, thinking, thinking of Dumbledore and the 
lies with which Rita Skeeter was defaming him ... 

 A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of 
the mirror again. He had imagined it, he must have done. He glanced over his shoulder, 
but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia's choosing: There was nothing blue 
there for the mirror to reflect. He peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing 
but his own bright green eye looking back at him. 

 He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because he had 
been thinking of his dead headmaster. If anything was certain, it was that the bright blue 
eyes of Albus Dumbledore would never pierce him again. 


Chapter Three 

The Dursleys Departing 

The sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice roared, 
Oh! You! 

Sixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt when his uncle was 
calling, nevertheless, he did not immediately respond. He was still at the narrow fragment 
in which, for a split second, he had thought he saw Dumbledores eye. It was not until his 
uncle bellowed, BOY! that Harry got slowly out of bed and headed for the bedroom 
door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he 
would be taking with him. 

You took you time! roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared at the top of 
the stairs, Get down here. I want a word! 

Harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his pants pockets. When he searched 
the living room he found all three Dursleys. They were dressed for packing; Uncle 
Vernon in an old ripped-up jacket and Dudley, Harrys, large, blond, muscular cousin, in 
his leather jacket. 

 Yes? asked Harry. 

 Sit down! said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows. Please! added 
Uncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat. 

Harry sat. He though he knew what was coming. His uncle began to pace up and down, 
Aunt Petunia and Dudley, following his movement with anxious expressions. Finally, his 
large purple face crumpled with concentration. Uncle Vernon stopped in front of Harry 
and spoke. 

 "I've changed my mind, he said. 

"What a surprise," said Harry. 

"Don't you take that tone" began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice, but Vernon 
Dursley waved her down 

"It's all a lot of claptrap, said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry with piggy little 
eyes. "I've decided I don't believe a word of it. Were staying put, were not going 
anywhere. 

Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement. 
Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every twenty four hours for the past four 
weeks, packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart. Harrys 
favorite moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware the Dudley had added 
his dumbbells to his case since the last time it been repacked, had attempted to hoist it 
back into the boot and collapsed with a yelp of pain and much swearing. 

According to you, Vernon Dursley said, now resuming his pacing up and down 
the living room, we C Petunia, Dudley, and I C are in danger. From C from C 

Some of my lot right? said Harry 

Well I dont believe it, repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front of 
Harry again. "I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it's a plot to get 
the house." 

 "The house?" repeated Harry. "What house?" 

 "This house!" shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein his forehead starting to pulse. 
"Our house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us out of the way and 


then you're going to do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in 
your name and C" 

 Are you out of your mind?" demanded Harry. "A plot to get this house? Are you 
actually as stupid as you look?" 

 "Don't you dare --!" squealed Aunt Petunia, but again Vernon waved her 
down. Slights on his personal appearance were it seemed as nothing to the danger he had 
spotted. 

 "Just in case you've forgotten," said Harry, "I've already got a house my godfather 
left me one. So why would I want this one? All the happy memories?" 

 There was silence. Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this 
argument. 

 "You claim," said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, "that this Lord Thing 
C" 

 "Voldemort," said Harry impatiently, "and we've been through this about a 
hundred times already. This isn't a claim, it's fact. Dumbledore told you last year, and 
Kingsley and Mr. Weasley C" 

Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed that his uncle 
was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit, a few days into Harry's 
summer holidays, of two fully grown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley 
Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the Dursleys. 
Harry had to admit, however that as Mr. Weasley had once demolished half of the living 
room, his reappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon. 

 "Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well," Harry pressed on 
remorselessly, "Once I'm seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, 
and that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, 
whether to torture you to try and find out where I am, or because he thinks by holding 
you hostage I'd come and try to rescue you." 

 Uncle Vernon's and Harry's eyes met. Harry was sure that in that instant they were 
both wondering the same thing. Then Uncle Vernon walked on and Harry resumed, 
"You've got to go into hiding and the Order wants to help. You're being offered serious 
protection, the best there is." 

 Uncle Vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down. Outside the sun 
hung low over the privet hedges. The next door neighbor's lawn mower stalled again. 

 "I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?" asked Vernon Dursley abruptly. 

 "There is," said Harry, surprised. 

"Well, then, why can't they protect us? It seems to me that, as innocent victims, guilty of 
nothing more than harboring a marked man, we ought to qualify for government 
protection!" 

Harry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical of his uncle to put 
his hopes in the establishment, even within this world that he despised and mistrusted. 

"You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said," Harry replied. 

"We think the Ministry has been infiltrated." 

 Uncle Vernon strode back to the fireplace and back breathing so strongly that his 
great black mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration. 


 "All right," he said. Stopping in front of Harry get again. "All right, let's say for 
the sake of argument we accept this protection. I still don't see why we can't have that 
Kingsley bloke." 

 Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This question had also 
been addressed half a dozen times. 

 "As I've told you," he said through gritted teeth, "Kingsley is protecting the Mug 
C I mean, your Prime Minister." 

 "Exactly C he's the best!" said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the blank television 
screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking along the Muggle Prime 
Minister as he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack 
of dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep 
voice, had caused the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not 
done with any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with 
earring in. 

 "Well, he's taken, said Harry. "But Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle are more 
than up to the job C" 

 "If we'd even seen CVs" began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost patience. Getting 
to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, not pointing at the TV set himself. 

 "These accidents aren't accidents C the crashed and explosions and derailments 
and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news. People are disappearing 
and dying and he's behind it C Voldemort. I've told you this over and over again, he kills 
Muggles for fun. Even the fogs C they're caused by dementors, and if you can't remember 
what they are, ask your son!" 

 Dudley's hands jerked upward to tower his mouth. With his parents' and Harry's 
eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, "There are more of them?" 

"More?" laughed Harry. "More than the two that attacked us, you mean? Of course there 
are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing as they feed off fear and despair" 

"All right, all right blustered," blustered Vernon Dursley. "You've made your 
point C" 

"I hope so," said Harry, "because once I'm seventeen, all of them C Death Eaters, 
elementors, maybe even Inferi C which means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard C 
will be able to find you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time 
you tried to outrun wizards, I think you'll agree you need help." 

There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid smashing down a 
wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years. Aunt Petunia 
was looking at Uncle Vernon; Dudley was staring at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon 
blurted out, "But what about my work? What about Dudley's school? I don't suppose 
those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards C" 

"Don't you understand?" shouted Harry. "They will torture and kill you like they 
did my parents!" 

"Dad," said Dudley in a loud voice, "Dad C I'm going with these Order people." 

"Dudley," said Harry, "for the first time in your life, you're talking sense." 

He knew the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened enough to accept the Order's help, 
his parents would accompany him. There could be no question of being separated from 
their Duddykins. Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece. 


"They'll be here in about five minutes, he said, and when one of the Dursleys 
replied, he left the room. The prospect of partingprobably forever C from his aunt, 
uncle, and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully but there was 
nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. What did you say to one another at the end 
of sixteen years' solid dislike? 

Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack then poked a 
couple of owl nuts through the bats of Hedwig's cage. They fell with dull thuds to the 
bottom where she ignored them. 

"We're leaving soon, really soon," Harry told her. "And then you'll be able to fly 
again." 

The doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his room and 
downstairs. It was too much to expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the Dursleys on 
their own. 

"Harry Potter!" squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry had opened the 
door; a small man in a mauve top hat that was sweeping him a deep bow. "An honor as 
ever!" 

"Thanks, Dedalus," said Harry, bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon 
the dark haired Hestia. "It's really good of you to do this They're through here, my aunt 
and uncle and cousin" 

"Good day to you, Harry Potter's relatives!" said Dedalus happily striding into the 
living room. The Dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus; Harry half 
expected another change of mind. Dudley shrank neared to his mother at the sight of the 
witch and wizard. 

"I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry has told you, is a 
simple one," said Dedalus, pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and 
examining it. "We shall be leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic 
in your house CHarry being still underage it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to 
arrest him C we shall be driving, say, ten miles or so before Disapparating to the safe 
location we have picked out for you. You know how to drive, I take it?" He asked Uncle 
Vernon politely. 

"Know how to C? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!" spluttered Uncle 
Vernon. 

"Very clever of you, sir, very clever. I personally would be utterly bamboozled by 
all those buttons and knobs," said Dedalus. He was clearly under the impression that he 
was flattering Vernon Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every 
word Dedalus spoke. 

"Can't even drive," he muttered under his breath, his mustache rippling 
indignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus nor Hestia seemed to hear him. 

"You, Harry," Dedalus continued, "will wait here for your guard. There has been 
a little change in the arrangements C" 

What d'you mean?" said Harry at once. "I thought Mad-Eye was going to come 
and take me by Side Along-Apparition?" 

"Can't do it," said Hestia tersely, "Mad-Eye will explain." 

The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension 
on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched, "Hurry up!" Harry looked all around the 
room before realizing the voice had issued from Dedalus's pocket watch. 


"Quite right, were operating to a very tight schedule," said Dedalus nodding at his 
watch and tucking it back into his waist coat. "We are attempting to time your departure 
from the house with your family's Disapparition, Harry thus the charm breaks the 
moment you all head for safety." He turned to the Dursleys, "Well, are we all packed and 
ready to go?" 

None of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring appalled at the bulge 
in Dedalus's waistcoat pocket. 

"Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus," murmured Hestia. She 
clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain the room while Harry and the 
Dursleys exchanged loving, possibly tearful farewells. 

"There's no need," Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further 
explanation unnecessary by saying loudly, 

"Well, this is good-bye then boy." 

He swung his right arm upward to shake Harry's hand, but at the last moment 
seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and 
forward like a metronome. 

 "Ready, Duddy?" asked Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as 
to avoid looking at Harry altogether. 

 Dudley did not answer but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar, reminding 
Harry a little of the giant, Grawp. 

 "Come along, then," said Uncle Vernon. 

He had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled, "I don't 
understand." 

"What don't you understand, popkin?" asked Petunia looking up at her son. 

Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry. 

"Why isn't he coming with us? 

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze when they stood staring at Dudley as 
though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina. 

"What?" said Uncle Vernon loudly. 

"Why isn't he coming too?" asked Dudley. 

"Well, hedoesn't want to," said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at Harry and 
adding, "You don't want to, do you?" 

"Not in the slightest," said Harry. 

"There you are," Uncle Vernon told Dudley. "Now come on we're off." 

He marched out of the room. They heard the front door open, but Dudley did not 
move and after a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too. 

"What now?" barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the doorway. 

It seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words. 
After several moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said, "But where's he 
going to go?" 

Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was clear that Dudley 
was frightening them. Hestia Jones broke the silence. 

"But surely you know where your nephew is going?" she asked looking 
bewildered. 

"Certainly we know," said Vernon Dursley. "He's off with some of your lot, isn't 
he? Right, Dudley, let's get in the car, you heard the man, we're in a hurry. 


Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did not 
follow. 

 "Off with some of our lot?" 

 Hestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude before Witches and wizards 
seemed stunned that his closed living relatives took so little interest in the famous Harry 
Potter. 

"It's fine," Harry assured her. "It doesn't matter, honestly." 

"Doesn't matter?" repeated Hestia, her voice rising considerably. 

"Don't these people realize what you've been through? What danger you are in? 
The unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti Voldemort movement?" 

 "Er Cno, they don't," said Harry. "They think I'm a waste of space, actually but I'm 
used to C" 

 "I don't think you're a waste of space" 

 If Harry had not seen Dudley's lips move, he might not have believed it. As it was, 
he stared at Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin 
who had spoken; for one thing, Dudley had turned red. Harry was embarrassed and 
astonished himself. 

 "Well... er thanks, Dudley." 

 Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression 
before mumbling, "You saved my life," 

 "Not really," said Harry. "It was your soul the dementor would have taken" 

 He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no contact during this 
summer or last, as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so briefly and kept to his room so 
much. It now dawned on Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he had 
trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all. Although rather touched he 
was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to 
express his feelings. After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley subsided into 
scarlet-faced silence. 

Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approving look that 
changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley rather than Harry. 

"S-so sweet, Dudders" she sobbed into his massive chest. "S-such a lovely b-boy s-
saying thank you" 

 "But he hasn't said thank you at all!" said Hestia indignantly. "He only said he 
didn't think Harry was a waste of space!" 

"Yea but coming from Dudley that's like 'I love you,'" said Harry, torn between 
annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he 
had just saved Harry from a burning building. 

"Are we going or not?" roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the living 
room door. "I thought we were on a tight schedule!" 

"Yes Cyes, we are," said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching these exchanged 
with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together. "We really must be 
off. Harry C" 

He tripped forward and wrung Harry's hand with both of his own. 

"good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizarding world rest upon 
your shoulders." 

"Oh," said Harry, "right. Thanks." 


"Farwell, Harry," said Hestia also clasping his hand. "Our thoughts go with you." 

"I hope everything's okay," said Harry with a glance toward Aunt Petunia and 
Dudley. 

"Oh I'm sure we shall end up the best of chums," said Diggle slightly, waving his 
hat as he left the room. Hestia followed him. 

Dudley gently released himself from his mother's clutches and walked toward 
Harry who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic. Then Dudley held out his 
large, pink hand. 

"Blimey, Dudley," said Harry over Aunt Petunia's renewed sobs, "did the 
dementors blow a different personality into you?" 

"Dunno," muttered Dudley, "See you, Harry." 

"Yea " said Harry, raking Dudley's hand and shaking it. "Maybe. Take care, 
Big D." 

Dudley nearly smiled. They lumbered from the room. Harry heard his heavy 
footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door slammed. 

Aunt Petunia whose face had been buried in her handkerchief looked around at 
the sound. She did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with Harry. Hastily 
stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket, she said, "Well C good-bye" and marched 
towards the door without looking at him. 

"Good-bye" said Harry. 

She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest feeling that 
she wanted to say something to him; She gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to 
teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a little of her head, she hustled out of the 
room after he husband and son. 

 

Chapter Four 

The Seven Potters 

 

Harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, arriving at the window just in time to see 
the Dursleys' car swinging out of the drive and off up the road. Dedaluss top hat was 
visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the backseat. The car turned right at the end 
of Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then 
it was gone. 

 Harry picked up Hedwigs cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his 
unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back 
downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the 
stairs. The light was fading rapidly, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt 
most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house 
for the last time. Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to 
enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat. Pausing only to sneak 
something tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on Dudleys computer, or 
put on the television and flicked through the channels to his hearts content. It gave him 
an odd, empty feeling remembering those times; it was like remembering a younger 
brother whom he had lost. 


 Dont you want to take a last look at the place? he asked Hedwig, who was still 
sulking with her head under her wing. Well never be here again. Dont you want to 
remember all the good times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories  Dudley 
sobbed on it after I saved him from the dementors  Turns out he was grateful after all, 
can you believe it?  And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door   

 Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to 
help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his 
back on the front door. 

 And under here, Hedwig C Harry pulled open a door under the stairs C is where 
I used to sleep! You never knew me then C Blimey, its small, Id forgotten   

 Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he 
used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more 
often than not adorned with a spider or two. Those had been the days before he had 
known anything about his true identity; before he had found out how his parents had died 
or why such strange things often happened around him. But Harry could still remember 
the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes 
of green light and once C Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry had 
recounted it C a flying motorbike  

 There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry straightened 
up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. Pausing only to 
employ a few of Uncle Vernons choicest swear words, he staggered back into the 
kitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden. 

 The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by one, 
figures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the 
scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous 
motorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around him other people were dismounting 
from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses. 

 Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was a 
general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapped him on the 
back, and Hagrid said, All righ, Harry? Ready fer the off? 

 Definitely, said Harry, beaming around at them all. But I wasnt expecting this 
many of you! 

 Change of plan, growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous bulging 
sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with 
dizzying rapidity. Lets get undercover before we talk you through it. 

 Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, they 
settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunias gleaming work surfaces, or leaned 
up against her spotless appliances; Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied 
back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-
haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, balding, his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-
worn, one-legged, his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short 
hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and 
beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald and broad-shouldered; Hagrid, 
with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the 
ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with his droopy beady 
hounds eyes and matted hair. Harrys heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He 


felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the 
last time they had met. 

 Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister? he 
called across the room. 

 He can get along without me for one night, said Kingsley, Youre more 
important. 

 Harry, guess what? said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine, 
and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glistened there. 

 You got married? Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin. 

 Im sorry you couldnt be there, Harry, it was very quiet. 

 Thats brilliant, congrat C 

 All right, all right, well have time for a cozy catch-up later, roared Moody over 
the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and 
turned to Harry. As Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius 
Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. Hes made it an imprisonable 
offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or 
out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you. 
Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mothers charm does that already. What hes really 
done is to stop you getting out of here safely. 

 Second problem: Youre underage, which means youve still got the Trace on 
you. 

 I dont C 

 The Trace, the Trace! said Mad-Eye impatiently. The charm that detects 
magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage 
magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is 
going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters. 

 We cant wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn seventeen 
youll lose all the protection your mother gave you. In short, Pius Thicknesse thinks hes 
got you cornered good and proper. 

 Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse. 

 So what are we going to do? 

 Were going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace 
cant detect, because we dont need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and 
Hagrids motorbike. 

 Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye 
the chance to address them. 

 Now, your mothers charm will only break under two conditions: when you 
come of age, or C Moody gestured around the pristine kitchen C you no longer call this 
place home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the 
full understanding that youre never going to live together again, correct? 

 Harry nodded. 

 So this time, when you leave, therell be no going back, and the charm will break 
the moment you get outside its range. Were choosing to break it early, because the 
alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn 
seventeen. 


 The one thing weve got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesnt know were 
moving you tonight. Weve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry: They think youre not 
leaving until the thirtieth. However, this is You-Know-Who were dealing with, so we 
cant rely on him getting the date wrong; hes bound to have a couple of Death Eaters 
patrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So, weve given a dozen different 
houses every protection we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place 
were going to hide you, theyve all got some connection with the Order: my house, 
Kingsleys place, Mollys Auntie Muriels C you get the idea. 

 Yeah, said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a gaping 
hole in the plan. 

 Youll be going to Tonkss parents. Once youre within the boundaries of the 
protective enchantments weve put on their house youll be able to use a Portkey to the 
Burrow. Any questions? 

 Er C yes, said Harry. Maybe they wont know which of the twelve secure 
houses Im heading for at first, but wont it be sort of obvious once C he performed a 
quick headcount C fourteen of us fly off toward Tonkss parents? 

 Ah, said Moody, I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us wont be 
flying to Tonkss parents. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies 
tonight, each of them with a companion, each pair heading for a different safe house. 

 From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud. 
There was no need for him to say another word; Harry understood the rest of the plan 
immediately. 

 No! he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. No way! 

 I told them youd take it like this, said Hermione with a hint of complacency. 

 If you think Im going to let six people risk their lives -- ! 

 because its the first time for all of us, said Ron. 

 This is different, pretending to be me C 

 Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry, said Fred earnestly. Imagine if 
something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever. 

 Harry did not smile. 

 You cant do it if I dont cooperate, you need me to give you some hair. 

 Well, thats the plan scuppered, said George. Obviously theres no chance at 
all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate. 

 Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke whos not allowed to use magic; weve 
got no chance, said Fred. 

 Funny, said Harry, really amusing. 

 If it has to come to force, then it will, growled Moody, his magical eye now 
quivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry. Everyone heres overage, Potter, and 
theyre all prepared to take the risk. 

 Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to glance 
at him out of the side of Moodys head. 

 Lets have no more arguments. Times wearing on. I want a few of your hairs, 
boy, now. 

 But this is mad, theres no need C 

 No need! snarled Moody. With You-Know-Who out there and half the 
Ministry on his side? Potter, if were lucky hell have swallowed the fake bait and hell 


be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but hed be mad not to have a Death Eater or 
two keeping an eye out, its what Id do. They might not be able to get at you or this 
house while your mothers charm holds, but its about to break and they know the rough 
position of the place. Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who cant split 
himself into seven. 

 Harry caught Hermiones eye and looked away at once. 

 So, Potter C some of your hair, if you please. 

 Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way. 

 Now! barked Moody. 

 With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head, grabbed 
a hank of hair, and pulled. 

 Good, said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of 
potion. Straight in here, if you please. 

 Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made contact with 
its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright 
gold. 

 Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry, said Hermione, 
before catching sight of Rons raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, Oh, you 
know what I mean C Goyles potion tasted like bogies. 

 Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please, said Moody. 

 Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunias 
gleaming sink. 

 Were one short, said Lupin. 

 Here, said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck 
and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along 
to stand between Fred and George instead. 

 Im a soldier, Id sooner be a protector, said Mundungus. 

 Shut it, growled Moody. As Ive already told you, you spineless worm, any 
Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore 
always said You-Know-Who would want to finish Potter in person. Itll be the protectors 
who have got the most to worry about, the Death Eatersll want to kill them. 

 Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling 
half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before 
pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one. 

 Altogether, then   

 Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. All of them gasped 
and grimaced as the potion hit their throats; At once, their features began to bubble and 
distort like hot wax. Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and 
George were shrinking; their hair was darkening, Hermiones and Fleurs appearing to 
shoot backward into their skulls. 

 Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had 
brought with him. When he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping 
and panting in front of him. 

 Fred and George turned to each other and said together, Wow C were identical! 

 I dunno, though, I think Im still better-looking, said Fred, examining his 
reflection in the kettle. 


 Bah, said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, Bill, dont look at me 
C Im ideous. 

 Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, Ive got smaller here, said Moody, 
indicating the first sack, and vice versa. Dont forget the glasses, theres six pairs in the 
side pocket. And when youre dressed, theres luggage in the other sack. 

 The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever 
seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangers 
rummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own 
things away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all 
began stripping off with impunity, clearly more at ease with displaying his body than 
they would have been with their own. 

 I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo, said Ron, looking down at his bare 
chest. 

 Harry, your eyesight really is awful, said Hermione, as she put on glasses. 

 Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each containing a 
stuffed snowy owl, from the second sack. 

 Good, said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and luggage-laden 
Harrys faced him. The pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be traveling with me, 
by broom C 

 Whym I with you? grunted the Harry nearest the back door. 

 Because youre the one that needs watching, growled Moody, and sure enough, 
his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued, Arthur and Fred C 

 Im George, said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. Cant you even tell 
us apart when were Harry? 

 Sorry, George C 

 Im only yanking your wand, Im Fred really C 

 Enough messing around! snarled Moody. The other one C George or Fred or 
whoever you are C youre with Remus. Miss Delacour C 

 Im taking Fleur on a thestral, said Bill. Shes not that fond of brooms. 

 Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slavish look that 
Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again. 

 Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral C 

 Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsleys smile; Harry knew that 
Hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick. 

 Which leaves you and me, Ron! said Tonks brightly, knocking over a mug tree 
as she waved at him. 

 Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione. 

 An youre with me, Harry. That all righ? said Hagrid, looking a little anxious. 
Well be on the bike, brooms an thestrals cant take me weight, see. Not a lot o room 
on the seat with me on it, though, so youll be in the sidecar. 

 Thats great, said Harry, not altogether truthfully. 

 We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom, said Moody, who 
seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. Snapes had plenty of time to tell them 
everything about you hes never mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, 
were betting theyll choose one of the Potters who looks at home on a broomstick. All 
right then, he went on, tying up the sack with the fake Potters clothes in it and leading 


the way back to the door, I make it three minutes until were supposed to leave. No 
point locking the back door, it wont keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking. 
Come on  

 Harry hurried to gather his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwigs cage and followed 
the group to the dark back garden. 

 On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been 
helped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid 
was standing ready beside the motorbike, goggles on. 

 Is this it? Is this Siriuss bike? 

 The very same, said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. An the last time yeh 
was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand! 

 Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar. It 
placed him several feet below everybody else: Ron smirked at the sight of him sitting 
there like a child in a bumper car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his 
feet and rammed Hedwigs cage between his knees. He was extremely uncomfortable. 

 Arthurs done a bit o tinkerin, said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harrys 
discomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank 
inches into the ground. Its got a few tricks up its sleeves now. Tha one was my idea. 
He pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer. 

"Please be careful, Hagrid." said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, 
holding his broomstick. "I'm still not sure that was advisable and it's certainly only to be 
used in emergencies." 

"All right, then." said Moody. "Everyone ready, please. I want us all to leave at 
exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion's lost." 

Everybody motioned their heads. 

"Hold tight now, Ron," said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a forcing, guilty look at 
Lupin before placing his hands on each side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike 
into life: It roared like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate. 

 Good luck, everyone, shouted Moody. See you all in about an hour at the 
Burrow. On the count of three. One  two .. THREE. 

 There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty 
lurch. He was rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off 
his face. Around him brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral 
flicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwigs cage and his rucksack, were 
already sore and starting to go numb. So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to 
take a last glimpse of number four Privet Drive. By the time he looked over the edge of 
the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. 

And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty 
hooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the middle of which the 
Order members had risen, oblivious C 

Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the 
motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were. Streetlights above him, 
yells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig's cage, the Firebolt, 
and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees C 

"No C HELP!" 


The broomstick spun too, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack 
and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second's relief, 
and then another burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage. 

"No C NO!" 

The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering 
as Hagrid blasted through their circle. 

"Hedwig C Hedwig C" 

But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage. He could 
not take it in, and his terror for the others was paramount. He glanced over his shoulder 
and saw a mass of people moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms 
soaring off into the distance, but he could not tell who they were C 

"Hagrid, we've got to go back, we've got to go back!" he yelled over the 
thunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig's cage into the 
floor, refusing to believe that she was dead. "Hagrid, TURN AROUND!" 

"My job's ter get you there safe, Harry!" bellow Hagrid, and he opened the throttle. 

"Stop C STOP!" Harry shouted, but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew 
past his left ear: Four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing 
them, aiming for Hagrid's broad back. Hagrid swerved, but the Death Eaters were 
keeping up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and Harry had to sink low into the 
sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling around he cried, "Stupefy!" and a red bolt of light shot 
from his own wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they 
scattered to avoid it. 

"Hold on, Harry, this'll do for 'em!" roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up just in 
time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge. 

A wall, a solid black wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning his neck, Harry saw it 
expand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the 
fourth was not so lucky; He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from 
behind it, his broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, 
but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the 
handlebars and sped up. 

More Killing Curses flew past Harry's head from the two remaining Death Eaters' 
wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells: Red 
and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought 
wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was 
happening C 

"Here we go again, Harry, hold on!" yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed at a second 
button. This time a great net burst from the bike's exhaust, but the Death Eaters were 
ready for it. Not only did they swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to 
save their unconscious friend had caught up. He bloomed suddenly out of the darkness 
and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, all shooting curses after it. 

"This'll do it, Harry, hold on tight!" yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw him slam his 
whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer. 

With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the exhaust, white-
hot and blue, and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching 
metal. Harry saw the Death Eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, 


and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: Its metal connections to the bike 
had splintered with the force of acceleration. 

"It's all righ', Harry!" bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto the back by the 
surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently 
in the bike's slipstream. 

"I'm on it, Harry, don' worry!" Hagrid yelled, and from inside his jacket pocket he 
pulled his flowery pink umbrella. 

"Hagrid! No! Let me!" 

"REPARO!" 

There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely. 
Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike's flight, then the sidecar began 
to lose height C 

In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, "Wingardium 
Leviosa!" 

The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne. He had but a 
split second's relief, however, as more curses streaked past him: The three Death Eaters 
were closing in. 

"I'm comin', Harry!" Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry could feel 
the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as low as he could, he pointed at the 
middle of the oncoming figures and yelled, "Impedimenta!" 

The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest; For a moment the man was 
absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier: One of his 
fellows almost collided with him C 

Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a 
curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth 
on the edge of his seat C 

"I'm comin', Harry, I'm comin'!" 

A huge hand seized the back of Harry's robes and hoisted him out of the 
plummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the 
motorbike's seat and found himself back-to-back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, 
away from the two remaining Death Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth, pointed 
his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, "Confringo!" 

He knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death 
Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back 
and vanished. 

"Harry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," moaned Hagrid, "I shouldn'ta tried ter repair it 
meself C yeh've got no room C" 

"It's not a problem, just keep flying!" Harry shouted back, as two more Death 
Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer. 

As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid swerved 
and zigzagged: Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, 
with Harry seated so insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at 
their pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them: The 
closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his 
next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike C Stan C 

"Expelliarmus!" Harry yelled. 


"That's him, it's him, it's the real one!" 

The hooded Death Eater's shout reached Harry even above the thunder of the 
motorbike's engine: Next moment, both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from 
view. 

"Harry, what's happened?" bellowed Hagrid. "Where've they gone?" 

"I don't know!" 

But Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted, "It's the real one!"; 
how had he known? He gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its 
menace. Where were they? 

He clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of 
Hagrid's jacket. 

"Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let's get out of here!" 

"Hold on tight, then, Harry!" 

There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot from the 
exhaust: Harry felt himself slipping backwards off what little of the seat he had. Hagrid 
flung backward upon him, barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars C 

"I think we've lost 'em Harry, I think we've done it!" yelled Hagrid. 

But Harry was not convinced; Fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for 
pursuers he was sure would come. . . . Why had they fallen back? One of them had still 
had a wand. . . . It's him. . . it's the real one. . . . They had said it right after he had tried to 
Disarm Stan. . . . 

"We're nearly there, Harry, we've nearly made it!" shouted Hagrid. 

Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still seemed 
remote as stars. 

Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire: as a Death Eater appeared on either 
side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters, cast from behind C 

And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind, without 
broomstick or thestral to hold him, his snake-like face gleaming out of the blackness, his 
white fingers raising his wand again C 

Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive. 
Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random into the whirling 
night. He saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a 
bang and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely 
out of control C 

Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way was up, 
which down: His scar was still burning; he expected to die at any second. A hooded 
figure on a broomstick was feet from him, he saw it raise its arm C 

"NO!" 

With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the Death Eater; to 
his horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death Eater, falling out of sight, their 
combined weight too much for the broomstick C 

Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard Voldemort 
scream, "Mine!" 

It was over: He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he glimpsed another 
Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard, "Avada C" 


As the pain from Harry's scar forced his eyes shut, his wand acted of its own 
accord. He felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire 
through his half-closed eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. The remaining Death 
Eater yelled; Voldemort screamed, "NO!" Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from 
the dragon-fire button. He punched it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more 
flames into the air, hurtling straight toward the ground. 

"Hagrid!" Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. "Hagrid C Accio 
Hagrid!" 

The motorbike sped up, sucked towards the earth. Face level with the handlebars, 
Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer: He was going to 
crash and there was nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream, 
"Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!" 

He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared into the red 
eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw: Voldemort preparing to curse 
him once more C 

And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread-eagled 
on the ground below him. He pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped 
for the brake, but with an earsplitting, ground trembling crash, he smashed into a muddy 
pond. 

 

Chapter Five 

Fallen Warrior 

 

"Hagrid?" 

 Harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of metal and leather that 
surrounded him; his hands sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand. He could 
not understand where Voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the 
darkness at any moment. Something hot and wet was trickling down his chin and from 
his forehead. He crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the 
ground that was Hagrid. 

 "Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me C" 

 But the dark mass did not stir. 

 "Who's there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?" 

 Harry did not recognize the man's voice. Then a woman shouted. "They've 
crashed. Ted! Crashed in the garden!" 

 Harry's head was swimming. 

 "Hagrid," he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled. 

 The next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions, with 
a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm. His missing tooth had been regrown. The 
scar on his forehead was still throbbing. 

 "Hagrid?" 

 He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar, lamplit 
sitting room. His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away, wet and muddy. A fair-
haired, big-bellied man was watching Harry anxiously. 


 "Hagrid's fine, son," said the man, "the wife's seeing to him now. How are you 
feeling? Anything else broken? I've fixed your ribs, your tooth, and your arm. I'm Ted, by 
the way, Ted Tonks C Dora's father." 

 Harry sat up too quickly. Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and 
giddy. 

 "Voldemort C" 

 "Easy, now," said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry's shoulder and pushing him 
back against the cushions. "That was a nasty crash you just had. What happened, 
anyway? Something go wrong with the bike? Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, 
him and his Muggle contraptions?" 

 "No," said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. "Death Eaters, loads of 
them C we were chased C" 

 "Death Eaters?" said Ted sharply. "What d'you mean, Death Eaters? I thought 
they didn't know you were being moved tonight, I thought C" 

 "They knew," said Harry. 

 Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky 
above. 

 "Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don't we? They shouldn't be 
able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction." 

 Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had been at the point 
when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the Order's charms. He only hoped they would 
continue to work: He imagined Voldemort, a hundred yards above them as they spoke, 
looking for a way to penetrate what Harry visualized as a great transparent bubble. 

 He swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with his own eyes before 
he would believe that he was alive. He had barely stood up, however, when a door 
opened and Hagrid squeezed through it, his face covered in mud and blood, limping a 
little but miraculously alive. 

 "Harry!" 

 Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered the floor between 
them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired 
ribs. "Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o' that? I thought we were both goners." 

 "Yeah, me too. I can't believe C" 

 Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind 
Hagrid. 

 "You!" he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty. 

 "Your wand's here, son," said Ted, tapping it on Harry's arm. "It fell right beside 
you, I picked it upAnd that's my wife you're shouting at." 

 "Oh, I'm C I'm sorry." 

 As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks's resemblance to her sister 
Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a lights oft brown and her eyes 
were wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry's 
exclamation. 

 "What happened to our daughter?" she asked. "Hagrid said you were ambushed; 
where is Nymphadora?" 

 "I don't know," said Harry. "We don't know what happened to anyone else." 


 She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry at the 
sight of their expressions, if any of the others had died, it was his fault, all his fault. He 
had consented to the plan, given them his hair . . . 

 "The Portkey," he said, remembering all of a sudden. "We've got to get back to 
the Burrow and find out C then we'll be able to send you word, or C or Tonks will, once 
she's C" 

 "Dora'll be ok, 'Dromeda," said Ted. "She knows her stuff, she's been in plenty of 
tight spots with the Aurors. The Portkey's through here," he added to Harry. "It's 
supposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take it." 

 "Yeah, we do," said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his shoulders. "I 
C" 

 He looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he 
left her and for which he felt so terribly responsible, but no words occurred to him that he 
did not seem hollow and insincere. 

 "I'll tell Tonks C Dora C to send word, when she . . . Thanks for patching us up, 
thanks for everything, I C" 

 He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short hallway and 
into a bedroom. Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid hitting his head on the 
door lintel. 

 "There you go, son. That's the Portkey." 

 Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush lying on the dressing 
table. 

 "Thanks," said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready to leave. 

 "Wait a moment," said Hagrid, looking around. "Harry, where's Hedwig?" 

 "She . . . she got hit," said Harry. 

 The realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung 
his eyes. The owl had been his companion, his one great link with the magical world 
whenever he had been forced to return to the Dursleys. 

 Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder. 

 "Never mind," he said gruffly, "Never mind. She had a great old life C" 

 "Hagrid!" said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed bright blue, and 
Hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time. 

 With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged 
him forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, his finger glued 
to the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Second later, Harry's feet 
slammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow. 
He heard screams. Throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, 
swaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and Ginny running down the steps by the back 
door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to his feet. 

 "Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?" cried 
Mrs. Weasley. 

 "What d'you mean? Isn't anyone else back?" Harry panted. 

 The answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley's pale face. 

 "The Death Eaters were waiting for us," Harry told her, "We were surrounded the 
moment we took off C they knew it was tonight C I don't know what happened to anyone 


else, four of them chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort 
caught up with us C" 

 He could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the plea for her to understand 
why he did not know what had happened to her sons, but C 

 "Thank goodness you're all right," she said, pulling him into a hug he did not feel 
he deserved. 

 "Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Molly?" asked Hagrid a little shakily, "Fer 
medicinal purposes?" 

 She could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back toward the 
crooked house, Harry knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned to Ginny and she 
answered his unspoken plea for information at once. 

 "Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed their Portkey, it 
came back without them," she said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. 
"And that one," she pointed at an ancient sneaker, "should have been Dad and Fred's, 
they were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were third and," she checked her 
watch, "if they made it, George and Lupin aught to be back in about a minute." 

 Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed to Hagrid. 
He uncorked it and drank it straight down in one. 

 "Mum!" shouted Ginny pointing to a spot several feet away. 

 A blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew larger and brighter, and Lupin 
and George appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry knew immediately that there was 
something wrong: Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face 
was covered in blood. 

 Harry ran forward and seized George's legs. Together, he and Lupin carried 
George into the house and through the kitchen to the living room, where they laid him on 
the sofa. As the lamplight fell across George's head, Ginny gasped and Harry's stomach 
lurched: One of George's ears was missing. The side of his head and neck were drenched 
in wet, shockingly scarlet blood. 

 No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son that Lupin grabbed Harry by the 
upper arm and dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was 
still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door. 

 "Oi!" said Hagrid indignantly, "Le' go of him! Le' go of Harry!" 

 Lupin ignored him. 

 "What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office 
at Hogwarts?" he said, giving Harry a small shake. "Answer me!" 

 "A C a grindylow in a tank, wasn't it?" 

 Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard. 

 "Wha' was tha' about?" roared Hagrid. 

 "I'm sorry, Harry, but I had to check," said Lupin tersely. "We've been betrayed. 
Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have 
told him were directly involved in the plan. You might have been an impostor." 

 "So why aren' you checkin' me?" panted Hagrid, still struggling with the door. 

 "You're half-giant," said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. "The Polyjuice Potion is 
designed for human use only." 

 "None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight," said 
Harry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of them. "Voldemort 


only caught up with me toward the end, he didn't know which one I was in the beginning. 
If he'd been in on the plan he'd have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid." 

 "Voldemort caught up with you?" said Lupin sharply. "What happened? How did 
you escape?" 

 Harry explained how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize 
him as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they must have 
summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the 
sanctuary of Tonks's parents. 

 "They recognized you? But how? What had you done?" 

 "I . . ." Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic 
and confusion. "I saw Stan Shunpike . . . . You know, the bloke who was the conductor 
on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of C well, he doesn't know what 
he's doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!" 

 Lupin looked aghast. 

 "Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill 
you! At least Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!" 

 "We were hundreds of feet up! Stan's not himself, and if I Stunned him and he'd 
fallen, he'd have died the same as if I'd used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me 
from Voldemort two years ago," Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the 
sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach 
Dumbledore's Army how to Disarm. 

 "Yes, Harry," said Lupin with painful restraint, "and a great number of Death 
Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual move then, under 
the imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either 
witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!" 

 "So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?" said Harry angrily. 

 "Of course not," said Lupin, "but the Death Eaters C frankly, most people! C 
would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the 
Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become 
so!" 

 Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of defiance 
inside him. 

 "I won't blast people out of my way just because they're there," said Harry, "That's 
Voldemort's job." 

 Lupin's retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, Hagrid 
staggered to a chair and sat down; it collapsed beneath him. Ignoring his mingled oaths 
and apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again. 

 "Will George be okay?" 

 All Lupin's frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question. 

 "I think so, although there's no chance of replacing his ear, not when it's been 
cursed off C" 

 There was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry leapt 
over Hagrid's legs and sprinted into the yard. 

 Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he realized 
they were Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both 
clutching a bent coat hanger, Hermione flung herself into Harry's arms, but Kingsley 


showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione's shoulder Harry saw him 
raise his wand and point it at Lupin's chest. 

 "The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us!" 

 "'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,'" said Lupin calmly. 

 Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, "It's him, I've checked!" 

 "All right, all right!" said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his cloak, 
"But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!" 

 "So it seems," replied Lupin, "but apparently they did not realize that there would 
be seven Harrys." 

 "Small comfort!" snarled Kingsley. "Who else is back?" 

 "Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me." 

 Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand. 

 "What happened to you?" Lupin asked Kingsley. 

 "Followed by five, injured two, might've killed one," Kingsley reeled off, "and we 
saw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty 
quickly. Remus, he can C" 

 "Fly," supplied Harry. "I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me." 

 "So that's why he left, to follow you!" said Kingsley, "I couldn't understand why 
he'd vanished. But what made him change targets?" 

 "Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike," said Lupin. 

 "Stan?" repeated Hermione. "But I thought he was in Azkaban?" 

 Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh. 

 "Hermione, there's obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has 
hushed up. Travers's hood fell off when I cursed him, he's supposed to be inside too. But 
what happened to you, Remus? Where's George?" 

 "He lost an ear," said Lupin. 

 "lost an -- ?" repeated Hermione in a high voice. 

 "Snape's work," said Lupin. 

 "Snape?" shouted Harry. "You didn't say C" 

 "He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a specialty of 
Snape's. I wish I could say I'd paid him back in kind, but it was all I could do to keep 
George on the broom after he was injured, he was losing so much blood." 

 Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There was no 
sign of movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent, unobscured by flying 
friends. Where was Ron? Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, 
Tonks, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus? 

 "Harry, give us a hand!" called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was 
stuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him free, the headed through the 
empty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still 
tending to George. Mrs. Weasley had staunched his bleeding now, and by the lamplight 
Harry saw a clean gaping hole where George's ear had been. 

 "How is he?" 

 Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, "I can't make it grow back, not when it's 
been removed by Dark Magic. But it could've been so much worse . . . . He's alive." 

 "Yeah," said Harry. "Thank God." 

 "Did I hear someone else in the yard?" Ginny asked. 


 "Hermione and Kingsley," said Harry. 

 "Thank goodness," Ginny whispered. They looked at each other; Harry wanted to 
hug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs. Weasley was there, but 
before he could act on the impulse, there was a great crash from the kitchen. 

 "I'll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I've seen my son, now back off if you know 
what's good for you!" 

 Harry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He burst into the living 
room, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, 
both pale but uninjured. 

 "Arthur!" sobbed Mrs. Weasley. "Oh thank goodness!" 

 "How is he?" 

 Mr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the first time since Harry 
had known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words. He gaped over the back of the sofa at 
his twin's wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing. 

 Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father's arrival, George stirred. 

 "How do you feel, Georgie?" whispered Mrs. Weasley. 

 George's fingers groped for the side of his head. 

 "Saintlike," he murmured. 

 "What's wrong with him?" croaked Fred, looking terrified. "Is his mind affected?" 

 "Saintlike," repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. 
"You see. . . I'm holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?" 

 Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded Fred's pale face. 

 "Pathetic," he told George. "Pathetic! With the whole wide world of ear-related 
humor before you, you go for holey?" 

 "Ah well," said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother. "You'll be able to tell 
us apart now, anyway, Mum." 

 He looked around. 

 "Hi, Harry C you are Harry, right?" 

 "Yeah, I am," said Harry, moving closer to the sofa. 

 "Well, at least we got you back okay," said George. "Why aren't Ron and Bill 
huddled round my sickbed?" 

 "They're not back yet, George," said Mrs. Weasley. George's grin faded. Harry 
glanced at Ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back outside. As they walked 
through the kitchen she said in a low voice. 

 "Ron and Tonks should be back by now. They didn't have a long journey; Auntie 
Muriel's not that far from here." 

 Harry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the 
Burrow, but now it enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his skin, throbbing in his chest, 
clogging his throat. As they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took 
his hand. 

 Kingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the sky every time he 
turned. Harry was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the living room a million years ago. 
Hagrid, Hermione, and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None 
of them looked around when Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil. 


 The minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. The slightest 
breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the 
hope that one of the missing Order members might leap unscathed from its leaves C 

 And then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the 
ground C 

 "It's them!" screamed Hermione. 

 Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere. 

 "Remus!" Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin's arms. His face 
was set and white: He seemed unable to speak, Ron tripped dazedly toward Harry and 
Hermione. 

 "You're okay," he mumbled, before Hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly. 

 "I thought C I thought C" 

 "'M all right," said Ron, patting her on the back. "'M fine." 

 "Ron was great," said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin. 
"Wonderful. Stunned one of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you're 
aiming at a moving target from a flying broom C" 

 "You did?" said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around his neck. 

 "Always the tone of surprise," he said a little grumpily, breaking free. "Are we the 
last back?" 

 "No," said Ginny, "we're still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad-Eye and 
Mundungus. I'm going to tell Mum and Dad you're okay, Ron C" 

 She ran back inside. 

 "So what kept you? What happened?" Lupin sounded almost angry at Tonks. 

 "Bellatrix," said Tonks. "She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus, 
She tried very hard to kill me. I just wish I'd got her, I owe Bellatrix. But we definitely 
injured Rodolphus . . . . Then we got to Ron's Auntie Muriel's and we missed our Portkey 
and she was fussing over us C" 

 A muscle was jumping in Lupin's jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say 
anything else. 

 "So what happened to you lot?" Tonks asked, turning to Harry, Hermione, and 
Kingsley. 

 They recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the time the continued 
absence of Bill, Fleur, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost, its 
icy bite harder and harder to ignore. 

 "I'm going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been there an 
hour ago," said Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. "Let me know 
when they're back,." 

 Lupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the darkness 
toward the gate. Harry thought he heard the faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just 
beyond the Burrow's boundaries. 

 Mr. And Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny behind them. 
Both parents hugged Ron before turning to Lupin and Tonks. 

 "Thank you," said Mrs. Weasley, "for our sons." 

 "Don't be silly, Molly," said Tonks at once. 

 "How's George?" asked Lupin. 

 "What's wrong with him?" piped up Ron. 


 "He's lost C" 

 But the end of Mrs. Weasley's sentence was drowned in a general outcry. A 
thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them. Bill and Fleur slid 
from its back, windswept but unhurt. 

 "Bill! Thank God, thank God C" 

 Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory. 
Looking directly at his father, he said, "Mad-Eye's dead." 

 Nobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something inside him was 
falling, falling through the earth, leaving him forever. 

 "We saw it," said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the 
light from the kitchen window. "It happened just after we broke out of the circle: Mad-
Eye and Dung were close by us, they were heading north too. Voldemort C he can fly C 
went straight for them. Dung panicked, I heard him cry out, Mad-Eye tried to stop him, 
but he Disapparated. Voldemort's curse hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell backward off 
his broom and C there was nothing we could do, nothing, we had half a dozen of them on 
our own tail C" 

 Bill's voice broke. 

 "Of course you couldn't have done anything," said Lupin. 

 They all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite comprehend it. Mad-
Eye dead; it could not be . . . . Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the consummate survivor . . . 

 At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there was no 
point of waiting in the yard anymore, and in silence they followed Mr. And Mrs. Weasley 
back into the Burrow, and into the living room, where Fred and George were laughing 
together. 

 "What's wrong?" said Fred, scanning their faces as they entered, "What's 
happened? Who's --?" 

 "Mad-Eye," said Mr. Weasley, "Dead." 

 The twins' grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed to know what to do. 
Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief: She had been close to Mad-Eye, Harry 
knew, his favorite and his protge at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down 
on the floor in the corner where he had most space, was dabbing at his eyes with his 
tablecloth-sized handkerchief. 

 Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of fire-whisky and some 
glasses. 

 "Here," he said, and with a wave of his wand, eh sent twelve full glasses soaring 
through the room to each of them, holding the thirteenth aloft. "Mad-Eye." 

 "Mad-Eye," they all said, and drank. 

 "Mad-Eye," echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup. The firewhisky seared 
Harry's throat. It seemed to burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness and 
sense of unreality firing him with something that was like courage. 

 "So Mundungus disappeared?" said Lupin, who had drained his own glass in one. 

 The atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watching Lupin, both 
wanting him to go on, it seemed to Harry, and slightly afraid of what they might hear. 

 "I know what you're thinking," said Bill, "and I wondered that too, on the way 
back here, because they seemed to be expecting us, didn't they? But Mundungus can't 
have betrayed us. They didn't know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the 


moment we appeared, and in case you've forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested 
that little bit of skullduggery. Why wouldn't he have told them the essential point? I think 
Dung panicked, it's as simple as that. He didn't want to come in the first place, but Mad-
Eye made him, and You-Know-Who went straight for them. It was enough to make 
anyone panic." 

 "You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to," sniffed Tonks. 
"Mad-Eye said he'd expect the real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled Aurors. He 
chased Mad-Eye first, and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to 
Kingsley. . . . " 

 "Yes, and zat eez all very good," snapped Fleur, "but still eet does not explain 'ow 
zey know we were moving 'Arry tonight, does eet? Somebody must 'ave been careless. 
Somebody let slip ze date to an outsider. It is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze 
date but not ze 'ole plan." 

 She glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face, silently 
daring any of them to contradict her. Nobody did. The only sound to break the silence 
was that of Hagrid hiccupping from behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, 
who had just risked his own life to save Harry's C Hagrid, whom he loved, whom he 
trusted, who had once been tricked into giving Voldemort crucial information in 
exchange for a dragon's egg. . . . 

 "No," Harry said aloud, and they all looked at him, surprised: The firewhisky 
seemed to have amplified his voice. "I mean . . . if somebody made a mistake," Harry 
went on, "and let something slip, I know they didn't mean to do it. It's not their fault," he 
repeated, again a little louder than he would usually have spoken. "We've got to trust each 
other. I trust all of you, I don't think anyone in this room would ever sell me to 
Voldemort." 

 More silence followed his words. They were all looking at him; Harry felt a little 
hot again, and drank some more firewhisky for something to do. As he drank, he thought 
of Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye had always been scathing about Dumbledore's willingness to trust 
people. 

 "Well said, Harry," said Fred unexpectedly. 

 "Year, 'ear, 'ear," said George, with half a glance at Fred, the corner of whose 
mouth twitched. 

 Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry. It was close to 
pitying. 

 "You think I'm a fool?" demanded Harry. 

 "No, I think you're like James," said Lupin, "who would have regarded it as the 
height of dishonor to mistrust his friends." 

 Harry knew what Lupin was getting at: that his father had been betrayed by his 
friend Peter Pettigrew. He felt irrationally angry. He wanted to argue, but Lupin had 
turned away from him, set down his glass upon a side table, and addressed Bill, "There's 
work to do. I can ask Kingsley whether C" 

 "No," said Bill at once, "I'll do it, I'll come." 

 "Where are you going?" said Tonks and Fleur together. 

 "Mad-Eye's body," said Lupin. "We need to recover it." 

 "Can't it -- ?" began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at Bill. 

 "Wait?" said Bill, "Not unless you'd rather the Death Eaters took it?" 


 Nobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said good bye and left. 

 The rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except for Harry, who remained 
standing. The suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence. 

 "I've got to go too," said Harry. 

 Ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him. 

 "Don't be silly, Harry," said Mrs. Weasley, "What are you talking about?" 

 "I can't stay here." 

 He rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again, he had not hurt like this for more 
than a year. 

 "You're all in danger while I'm here. I don't want C" 

 "But don't be so silly!" said Mrs. Weasley. "The whole point of tonight was to get 
you here safely, and thank goodness it worked. And Fleur's agreed to get married here 
rather than in France, we've arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look 
after you C" 

 She did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not better. 

 "If Voldemort finds out I'm here C" 

 "But why should he?" asked Mrs. Weasley. 

 "There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry," said Mr. Weasley. "He's got 
no way of knowing which safe house you're in." 

 "It's not me I'm worried for!" said Harry. 

 "We know that," said Mr. Weasley quietly, but it would make our efforts tonight 
seem rather pointless if you left." 

 "Yer not goin' anywhere," growled Hagrid. "Blimey, Harry, after all we wen' 
through ter get you here?" 

 "Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?" said George, hoisting himself up on his 
cushions. 

 "I know that C" 

 "Mad-Eye wouldn't want C" 

 "I KNOW!" Harry bellowed. 

 He felt beleaguered and blackmailed: Did they think he did not know what they 
had done for him, didn't they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he 
wanted to go now, before they had to suffer any more on his behalf? There was a long 
and awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb, and which was 
broken at last by Mrs. Weasley. 

 "Where's Hedwig, Harry?" she said coaxingly. "We can put her up with 
Pidwidgeon and give her something to eat." 

 His insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth. He drank the last of 
his firewhisky to avoid answering. 

 "Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry," said Hagrid. "Escaped him, fought 
him off when he was right on top of yeh!" 

 "It wasn't me," said Harry flatly. "It was my wand. My wand acted of its own 
accord." 

 After a few moments, Hermione said gently, "But that's impossible, Harry. You 
mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively." 


 "No," said Harry. "The bike was falling, I couldn't have told you where 
Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him, and 
it wasn't even a spell I recognized. I've never made gold flames appear before." 

 "Often," said Mr. Weasley, "when you're in a pressured situation you can produce 
magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before they're trained C" 

 "It wasn't like that," said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning. He felt 
angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to 
match Voldemort's. 

 No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he came 
to think of it, he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before. 

 His scar seared with pain, it was all he could do not to moan aloud. Muttering 
about fresh air, he set down his glass and left the room. 

 As he crossed the yard, the great skeletal thestral looked up C rustled its enormous 
batlike wings, then resumed its grazing. Harry stopped at the gate into the garden, staring 
out at its overgrown plants, rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore. 

 Dumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore would have 
known how and why Harry's wand had acted independently, because Dumbledore always 
had the answers; he had known about wands, had explained to Harry the strange 
connection that existed between his wand and Voldemort's . . . . But Dumbledore, like 
Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his parents, like his poor owl, all were gone where Harry could 
never talk to them again. He felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with 
firewhisky. . . . 

 And then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As he clutched his forehead 
and closed his eyes, a voice screamed inside his head. 

 "You told me the problem would be solved by using another's wand!" 

 And into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a 
stone floor, screaming, a horrible drawn-out scream, a scream of unendurable agony. . . . 

 "No! No! I beg you, I beg you. . . ." 

 "You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!" 

 "I did not. . . . I swear I did not. . . ." 

 "You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!" 

 "I swear I did not. . . . I believed a different wand would work. . . ." 

 "Explain, then, what happened. Lucius's wand is destroyed!" 

 "I cannot understand. . . . The connection . . . exists only . . between your two 
wands. . . ." 

 "Lies!" 

 "Please . . . I beg you. . . ." 

 And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Voldemort's surge of 
vicious anger, saw the frail old main on the floor writhe in agony C 

 "Harry?" 

 It was over as quickly as it had come: Harry stood shaking in the darkness, 
clutching the gate into the garden, his heart racing, his scar still tingling. It was several 
moments before he realized that Ron and Hermione were at his side. 

 "Harry, come back in the house," Hermione whispered, "You aren't still thinking 
of leaving?" 

 "Yeah, you've got to stay, mate," said Ron, thumping Harry on the back. 


 "Are you all right?" Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry's face. 
"You look awful!" 

 "Well," said Harry shakily, "I probably look better than Ollivander. . . ." 

 When he had finished telling them what he had seen, Ron looked appalled, but 
Hermione downright terrified. 

 "But it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar C it wasn't supposed to do this 
anymore! You mustn't let that connection open up again C Dumbledore wanted you to 
close your mind!" 

 When he did not reply, she gripped his arm. 

 "Harry, he's taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the Wizarding 
world! Don't let him inside your head too!" 

 

Chapter Six 

The Ghoul in Pajamas 

 

The shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in the days that followed; 
Harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other Order 
members, who passed in and out to relay news. Harry felt that nothing but action would 
assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find 
and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible. 

Well, you cant do anything about the C Ron mouthed the word Horcruxes C 
till youre seventeen. Youve still got the Trace on you. And we can plan here as well as 
anywhere, cant we? Or, he dropped his voice to a whisper, dyou reckon you already 
know where the You-Know-Whats are? 

No, Harry admitted. 

I think Hermiones been doing a bit of research, said Ron. She said she was 
saving it for when you got here. 

They were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had just left for 
work. Mrs. Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny, while Fleur had 
drifted off to take a bath. 

The Tracell break on the thirty-first, said Harry. That means I only need to 
stay here four days. Then I can C 

Five days, Ron corrected him firmly. Weve got to stay for the wedding. 
Theyll kill us if we miss it. 

Harry understood they to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley. 

Its one extra day, said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous. 

Dont they realize how important C? 

Course they dont, said Ron. They havent got a clue. And now you mention 
it, I wanted to talk to you about that. 

Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs. Weasley was not 
returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry. 

Mums been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What were off to do. 
Shell try you next, so brace yourself. Dad and Lupinve both asked as well, but when we 


said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. 
Shes determined. 

Rons prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs. Weasley 
detached Harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone mans sock that she 
thought might have come out of his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny 
scullery off the kitchen, she started. 

Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of 
Hogwarts, she began in a light, casual tone. 

Oh, said Harry. Well, yeah. We are. 

The mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what looked like 
one of Mr. Weasleys vests. 

May I ask why you are abandoning your education? said Mrs. Weasley. 

Well, Dumbledore left me . . . stuff to do, mumbled Harry. Ron and Hermione 
know about it, and they want to come too. 

What sort of stuff? 

Im sorry, I cant C 

Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and Im sure Mr. And 
Mrs. Granger would agree! said Mrs. Weasley. Harry had been afraid of the concerned 
parent attack. He forced himself to look directly into her eyes, noticing as he did so that 
they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginnys. This did not help. 

Dumbledore didnt want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. Im sorry. Ron and 
Hermione dont have to come, its their choice C 

I dont see that you have to go either! she snapped, dropping all pretense now. 
Youre barely of age, any of you! Its utter nonsense, if Dumbledore needed work doing, 
he had the whole Order at his command! Harry, you must have misunderstood him. 
Probably he was telling you something he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he 
wanted youC 

I didnt misunderstand, said Harry flatly. Its got to be me. 

He handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying, which was 
patterned with golden bulrushes. 

And thats not mine. I dont support Puddlemere United. 

Oh, of course not, said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return 
to her casual tone. I should have realized. Well, Harry, while weve still got you here, 
you wont mind helping with the preparations for Bill and Fleurs wedding, will you? 
Theres still so much to do. 

No C I C of course not, said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden change of 
subject. 

Sweet of you, she replied, and she smiled as she left the scullery. 

From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron and Hermione so busy with 
preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think. The kindest 
explanation of this behavior would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them 
all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the terrors of their recent journey. After two days of 
nonstop cutlery cleaning, of color-matching favors, ribbons, and flowers, of de-gnoming 
the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canaps, however, Harry 
started to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out seemed to keep 
him, Ron, and Hermione away from one another; he had not had a chance to speak to the 


two of them alone since the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing 
Ollivander. 

I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and 
planning, shell be able to delay you leaving, Ginny told Harry in an undertone, as they 
laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay. 

And then what does she thinks going to happen? Harry muttered. Someone 
else might kill off Voldemort while shes holding us here making vol-au-vents? 

He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginnys face whiten. 

So its true? she said. Thats what youre trying to do? 

I C not C I was joking, said Harry evasively. 

They stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in Ginnys 
expression. Suddenly Harry became aware that this was the first time that he had been 
alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He 
was sure she was remembering them too. Both of them jumped as the door opened, and 
Mr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill walked in. 

They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because the 
Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the headquarters. Mr. Weasley 
had explained that after the death of Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people 
to whom Dumbledore had confided Grimmauld Places location had become a Secret-
Keeper in turn. 

And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of the 
Fidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death Eaters to get the 
secret out of somebody. We cant expect it to hold much longer. 

But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now? asked 
Harry. 

Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there 
again. We hope theyll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he 
tries to talk about the place, but we cant be sure. It would have been insane to keep using 
the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky. 

The kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and 
forks. Harry found himself crammed beside Ginny; the unsaid things that had just passed 
between them made him wish they had been separated by a few more people. He was 
trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his chicken. 

No news about Mad-Eye? Harry asked Bill. 

Nothing, replied Bill. 

They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because Bill and Lupin had 
failed to recover his body. It had been difficult to know where he might have fallen, given 
the darkness and the confusion of the battle. 

The Daily Prophet hasnt said a word about him dying or about finding the 
body, Bill went on. But that doesnt mean much. Its keeping a lot quiet these days. 

And they still havent called a hearing about all the underage magic I used 
escaping the Death Eaters? Harry called across the table to Mr. Weasley, who shook his 
head. 

Because they know I had no choice or because they dont want me to tell the 
world Voldemort attacked me? 


The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesnt want to admit that You-Know-Who is as 
powerful as he is, nor that Azkabans seen a mass breakout. 

Yeah, why tell the public the truth? said Harry, clenching his knife so tightly 
that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white against his skin: I must 
not tell lies. 

Isnt anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him? asked Ron angrily. 

Of course, Ron, but people are terrified, Mr. Weasley replied, terrified that 
they will be next to disappear, their children the next to be attacked! There are nasty 
rumors going around; I for one dont believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts 
resigned. She hasnt been seen for weeks now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in 
his office all day; I just hope hes working on a plan. 

There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty plates onto the 
work surface and served apple tart. 

We must decide ow you will be disguised, Arry, said Fleur, once everyone 
had pudding. For ze wedding, she added, when he looked confused. Of course, none 
of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something 
slip after zey ave ad champagne. 

From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid. 

Yes, good point, said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table where she sat, 
spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that she had 
scribbled on a very long piece of parchment. Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your 
room yet? 

Why? exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother. 
Why does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine with it the way it is! 

We are holding your brothers wedding here in a few days time, young man C 

And are they getting married in my bedroom? asked Ron furiously. No! So 
why in the name of Merlins saggy left C 

Dont talk to your mother like that, said Mr. Weasley firmly. And do as youre 
told. 

Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last 
few mouthfuls of his apple tart. 

I can help, some of its my mess. Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut across 
him. 

No, Harry, dear, Id much rather you helped Arthur much out the chickens, and 
Hermione, Id be ever so grateful if youd change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame 
Delacour; you know theyre arriving at eleven tomorrow morning. 

But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens. Theres no need 
to, er, mention it to Molly, Mr. Weasley told Harry, blocking his access to the coop, but, 
er, Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Siriuss bike and, er, Im hiding C thats 
to say, keeping C it in here. Fantastic stuff: Theres an exhaust gaskin, as I believe its 
called, the most magnificent battery, and itll be a great opportunity to find out how 
brakes work. Im going to try and put it all back together again when Mollys not C I 
mean, when Ive got time. 

When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen, so Harry 
slipped upstairs to Rons attic bedroom. 


Im doing it, Im doing C ! Oh, its you, said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the 
room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. The room was 
just as messy as it had been all week; the only chance was that Hermione was now sitting 
in the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of 
which Harry recognized as his own, into two enormous piles. 

Hi, Harry, she said, as he sat down on his camp bed. 

And how did you manage to get away? 

Oh, Rons mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets 
yesterday, said Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and 
The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other. 

We were just talking about Mad-Eye, Ron told Harry. I reckon he might have 
survived. 

But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse, said Harry. 

Yeah, but Bill was under attack too, said Ron. How can he be sure what he 
saw? 

Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet, said 
Hermione, now weight Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand. 

He could have used a Shield Charm C 

Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand, said Harry. 

Well, all right, if you want him to be dead, said Ron grumpily, punching his 
pillow into a more comfortable shape. 

Of course we dont want him to be dead! said Hermione, looking shocked. Its 
dreadful that hes dead! But were being realistic! 

For the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eyes body, broken as Dumbledores had 
been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed 
with a bizarre desire to laugh. 

The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, thats why no ones found 
him, said Ron wisely. 

Yeah, said Harry. Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in 
Hagrids front garden. They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him C 

Dont! squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to see her 
burst into tears over her copy of Spellmans Syllabary. 

Oh no, said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. Hermione, I 
wasnt trying to upset C 

But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed and got 
there first. One arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a 
revolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily 
pulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, Tergeo. 

The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with himself, 
Ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione. 

Oh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . Im sorry. . . . She blew her nose and hiccupped. Its 
just so awf-ful, isnt it? R-right after Dumbledore . . . I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye 
dying, somehow, he seemed so tough! 

Yeah, I know, said Ron, giving her a squeeze. But you know what hed say to 
us if he was here? 

C-constant vigilance, said Hermione, mopping her eyes. 


Thats right, said Ron, nodding. Hed tell us to learn from what happened to 
him. And what Ive learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus. 

Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. A 
second later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders; she had dropped 
The Monster of Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt 
and snapped viciously at Rons ankle. 

Im sorry, Im sorry! Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from Rons 
leg and retied it shit. 

What are you doing with all those books anyway? Ron asked, limping back to 
his bed. 

Just trying to decide which ones to take with us, said Hermione, When were 
looking for the Horcruxes. 

Oh, of course, said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. I forgot well be 
hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library. 

Ha ha, said Hermione, looking down at Spellmans Syllabary. I wonder . . . 
will we need to translate runes? Its possible. . . . I think wed better take it, to be safe. 

She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up Hogwarts, 
A History. 

Listen, said Harry. 

He had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of 
resignation and defiance. 

I know you said after Dumbledores funeral that you wanted to come with me, 
Harry began. 

Here he goes, Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes. 

As we knew he would, he sighed, turning back to the books. You know, I 
think I will take Hogwarts, A History. Even if were not going back there, I dont think 
Id feel right if I didnt have it with C 

Listen! said Harry again. 

No, Harry, you listen, said Hermione. Were coming with you. That was 
decided months ago C years, really. 

But C 

Shut up, Ron advised him. 

C are you sure youve thought this through? Harry persisted. 

Lets see, said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the discarded pile 
with a rather fierce look. Ive been packing for days, so were ready to leave at a 
moments notice, which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult 
magic, not to mention smuggling Mad-Eyes whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under 
Rons mums nose. 

Ive also modified my parents memories so that theyre convinced theyre really 
called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their lifes ambition is to move to Australia, 
which they have now done. Thats to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them 
down and interrogate them about me C or you, because unfortunately, Ive told them quite 
a bit about you. 

Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, Ill find Mum and Dad and lift 
the enchantment. If I dont C well, I think Ive cast a good enough charm to keep them 


safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins dont know that theyve got a daughter, 
you see. 

Hermiones eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the bed, put 
his arm around her once more, and frowned at Harry as though reproaching him for lack 
of tact. Harry could not think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual 
for Ron to be teaching anyone else tact. 

I C Hermione, Im sorry C I didnt C 

Didnt realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come 
with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what youve done. 

Nah, hes just eaten, said Ron. 

Go on, he needs to know! 

Oh, all right. Harry, come here. 

For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped 
over to the door. 

Cmon. 

Why? Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny landing. 

Descendo, muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch opened 
right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. A horrible, half-sucking, half-
moaning sound came out of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open 
drains. 

Thats your ghoul, isnt it? asked Harry, who had never actually met the 
creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence. 

Yeah, it is, said Ron, climbing the ladder. Come and have a look at him. 

Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. His head and 
shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet 
from him, fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open. 

But it . . . it looks . . . do ghouls normally wear pajamas? 

No, said Ron. Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules. 

Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape and size, 
and was wearing what, now that Harrys eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly 
an old pair of Rons pajamas. He was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy 
and bald, rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters. 

Hes me, see? said Ron. 

No, said Harry. I dont. 

Ill explain it back in my room, the smells getting to me, said Ron. They 
climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, 
who was still sorting books. 

Once weve left, the ghouls going to come and live down here in my room, 
said Ron. I think hes really looking forward to it C well, its hard to tell, because all he 
can do is moan and drool C but he nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, hes going to 
be me with spattergroit. Good, eh? 

Harry merely looked his confusion. 

It is! said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilliance of the 
plan. Look, when we three dont turn up at Hogwarts again, everyones going to think 
Hermione and I must be with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight 
for our families to see if theyve got information on where you are. 


But hopefully itll look like Ive gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of Muggle-
borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment, said Hermione. 

We cant hide my whole family, itll look too fishy and they cant all leave their 
jobs, said Ron. So were going to put out the story that Im seriously ill with 
spattergroit, which is why I cant go back to school. If anyone comes calling to 
investigate, Mum or Dad can show them the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. 
Spattergroits really contagious, so theyre not going to want to go near him. It wont 
matter that he cant say anything, either, because apparently you cant once the fungus 
has spread to your uvula. 

And your mum and dad are in on this plan? asked Harry. 

Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum . . . well, youve 
seen what shes like. She wont accept were going till were gone. 

There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione 
continued to throw books onto one pile or the other. Ron sat watching her, and Harry 
looked from one to the other, unable to say anything. The measure they had taken to 
protect their families made him realize, more than anything else could have done, that 
they really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that 
would be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, but he simply could not find 
words important enough. 

Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting from four 
floors below. 

Ginnys probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring, said Ron. I dunno 
why the Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding. 

Fleurs sisters a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and shes too 
young to come on her own, said Hermione, as she pored indecisively over Break with a 
Banshee. 

Well, guests arent going to help Mums stress levels, said Ron. 

What we really need to decide, said Hermione, tossing Defensive Magical 
Theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up An Appraisal of Magical 
Education in Europe, is where were going after we leave here. I know you said you 
wanted to go to Godrics Hollow first, Harry, and I understand why, but . . . well . . . 
shouldnt we make the Horcruxes our priority? 

If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, Id agree with you, said Harry, 
who did not believe that Hermione really understood his desire to return to Godrics 
Hollow. His parents graves were only part of the attraction: He had a strong, though 
inexplicable, feeling that the place held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it 
was there that he had survived Voldemorts Killing Curse; now that he was facing the 
challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the place where it had happened, 
wanting to understand. 

Dont you think theres a possibility that Voldemorts keeping a watch on 
Godrics Hollow? Hermione asked. He might expect you to go back and visit your 
parents graves once youre free to go wherever you like? 

This had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a counterargument, 
Ron spoke up, evidently following his own train of thought. 

This R.A.B. person, he said. You know, the one who stole the real locket? 

Hermione nodded. 


He said in his note he was going to destroy it, didnt he? 

Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which 
R.A.B.s note was still folded. 

I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. Harry 
read out. 

Well, what if he did finish it off? said Ron. 

Or she. Interposed Hermione. 

Whichever, said Ron. itd be one less for us to do! 

Yes, but were still going to have to try and trace the real locket, arent we? said 
Hermione, to find out whether or not its destroyed. 

And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux? asked Ron. 

Well, said Hermione, Ive been researching that. 

How? asked Harry. I didnt think there were any books on Horcruxes in the 
library? 

There werent, said Hermione, who had turned pink. Dumbledore removed 
them all, but he C he didnt destroy them. 
Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed. 

How in the name of Merlins pants have you managed to get your hands on those 
Horcrux books? 

It C it wasnt stealing! said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of 
desperation. They were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the 
shelves. Anyway, if he really didnt want anyone to get at them, Im sure he would have 
made it much harder to C 

Get to the point! said Ron. 

Well . . . it was easy, said Hermione in a small voice. I just did a Summoning 
Charm. You know C Accio. And C they zoomed out of Dumbledores study window right 
into the girls dormitory. 

But when did you do this? Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a mixture of 
admiration and incredulity. 

Just after his C Dumbledores C funeral, said Hermione in an even smaller voice. 
Right after we agreed wed leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I 
went back upstairs to get my things it C it just occurred to me that the more we knew 
about them, the better it would be . . . and I was alone in there . . . so I tried . . . and it 
worked. They flew straight in through the open window and I C I packed them. 

She swallowed and then said imploringly, I cant believe Dumbledore would 
have been angry, its not as though were going to use the information to make a Horcrux, 
is it? 

Can you hear us complaining? said Ron. Where are these books anyway? 

Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large 
volume, bound in faded black leather. She looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly 
as if it were something recently dead. 

This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. Secrets 
of the Darkest Art C its a horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when 
Dumbledore removed it from the library. . . . if he didnt do it until he was headmaster, I 
bet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here. 


Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if hed already 
read that? asked Ron. 

He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your 
soul into seven, said Harry. Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a 
Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them. I think youre right, Hermione, that 
could easily have been where he got the information. 

And the more Ive read about them, said Hermione, the more horrible they 
seem, and the less I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in this book how 
unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it, and thats just by making one 
Horcrux! 

Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving beyond 
usual evil. 

Isnt there any way of putting yourself back together? Ron asked. 

Yes, said Hermione with a hollow smile, but it would be excruciatingly 
painful. 

Why? How do you do it? asked Harry. 

Remorse, said Hermione. Youve got to really feel what youve done. Theres 
a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I cant see Voldemort attempting it 
somehow, can you? 

No, said Ron, before Harry could answer. So does it say how to destroy 
Horcruxes in that book? 

Yes, said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting 
entrails, because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments 
on them. From all that Ive read, what Harry did to Riddles diary was one of the few 
really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux. 

What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang? asked Harry. 

Oh well, lucky weve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then, said Ron. 
I was wondering what we were going to do with them. 

It doesnt have to be a basilisk fang, said Hermione patiently. It has to be 
something so destructive that the Horcrux cant repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one 
antidote, and its incredibly rare C 

C phoenix tears, said Harry, nodding. 

Exactly, said Hermione. Our problem is that there are very few substances as 
destructive as basilisk venom, and theyre all dangerous to carry around with you. Thats 
a problem were going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a 
Horcrux wont do the trick. Youve got to put it beyond magical repair. 

But even if we wreck the thing it lives in, said Ron, why cant the bit of soul in 
it just go and live in something else? 

Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being. 

Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on. 
Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldnt 
damage your soul at all. 

Which would be a real comfort to me, Im sure, said Ron. Harry laughed. 

It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your 
soul will survive, untouched, said Hermione. But its the other way round with a 


Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for 
survival. It cant exist without it. 

That diary sort of died when I stabbed it, said Harry, remembering ink pouring 
like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemorts soul as 
it vanished. 

And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no 
longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but 
obviously it came back good as new. 

Hang on, said Ron, frowning. The bit of soul in that diary was possessing 
Ginny, wasnt it? How does that work, then? 

While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and 
out of someone if they get too close to the object. I dont mean holding it for too long, its 
nothing to do with touching it, she added before Ron could speak. I mean close 
emotionally. Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly 
vulnerable. Youre in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux. 

I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring? said Harry. Why didnt I ask 
him? I never really . . . 

His voice trailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should have asked 
Dumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that he had 
wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more . . . to 
find out everything. . . . 

The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking 
crash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked 
under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded 
Chocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry 
instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, 
whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage. 

Im so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering, she said, her voice trembling. 
Im sure you all need your rest . . . but there are wedding presents stacked in my room 
that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help. 

Oh yes, said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her feet, sending books 
flying in every direction. we will . . . were sorry . . . 

With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the room after 
Mrs. Weasley. 

its like being a house-elf, complained Ron in an undertone, still massaging his 
head as he and Harry followed. Except without the job satisfaction. The sooner this 
weddings over, the happier, Ill be. 

Yeah, said Harry, then well have nothing to do except find Horcruxes. . . . 
Itll be like a holiday, wont it? 

Ron started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents 
waiting for them in Mrs. Weasleys room, stopped quite abruptly. 

The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o clock. Harry, Ron, 
Hermione and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleurs family by this time; and 
it was with ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry 
attempted to flatten his hair. Once they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped 
out into the sunny backyard to await the visitors. 


Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old 
Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by 
two new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was 
no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had 
been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden had been pruned, 
plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, 
thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes. 

He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the 
Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer 
possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had 
therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by 
Portkey. The first sound of their approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, which 
turned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, 
laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf green robes, who 
could be Fleurs mother. 

Maman! cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. Papa! 

Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a head 
shorter and extremely plumb, with a little, pointed black beard. However, he looked 
good-natured. Bouncing towards Mrs. Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice 
on each cheek, leaving her flustered. 

You ave been so much trouble, he said in a deep voice. Fleur tells us you ave 
been working very ard. 

Oh, its been nothing, nothing! trilled Mrs. Weasley. No trouble at all! 

Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from 
behind one of the new Flutterby bushes. 

Dear lady! said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasleys hand between 
his own two plump ones and beaming. We are most honored at the approaching union of 
our two families! Let me present my wife, Apolline. 

Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Weasley too. 

Enchante, she said. Your usband as been telling us such amusing stories! 

Mr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look, upon which 
he became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a 
close friend. 

And, of course, you ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle! said Monsieur 
Delacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist-length hair of 
pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw 
Harry a glowing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly. 

Well, come in, do! said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Delacours 
into the house, with many No, please!s and After you!s and Not at all!s. 

The Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They were 
pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding. 
Monsieur Delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids 
shoes Charmant! Madame Delacour was most accomplished at household spells and 
had the oven properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying 
to assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid French. 


On the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many people. Mr. 
and Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur 
and Madame Delacours protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was 
sleeping with Fleur in Percys old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best 
man, once Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became 
virtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron and Hermione took to 
volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house. 

But she still wont leave us alone! snarled Ron, and their second attempt at a 
meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket 
of laundry in her arms. 

Oh, good, youve fed the chickens, she called as she approached them. Wed 
better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow . . . to put up the tent for the 
wedding, she explained, pausing to lean against the henhouse. She looked exhausted. 
Millamants Magic Marquees . . . theyre very good. Bills escorting them. . . . Youd 
better stay inside while theyre here, Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a 
wedding, having all these security spells around the place. 

Im sorry, said Harry humbly. 

Oh, dont be silly, dear! said Mrs. Weasley at once. I didnt mean C well, your 
safetys much more important! Actually, Ive been wanting to ask you how you want to 
celebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen, after all, its an important day. . . . 

I dont want a fuss, said Harry quickly, envisaging the additional strain this 
would put on them all. Really, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine. . . . Its 
the day before the wedding. . . . 

Oh, well, if youre sure, dear. Ill invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And how 
about Hagrid? 

Thatd be great, said Harry. But please, dont go to loads of trouble. 

Not at all, not at all . . . Its no trouble. . . . 

She looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly, straightened 
up, and walked away. Harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line, and 
the damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great 
wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her. 

 

 

Chapter Seven 

 The Will of Albus Dumbledore 

 

He was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue light of dawn. Far below, 
swathed in mist, was the shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought down there, the 
man he needed so badly he could think of little else, the man who held the answer, the 
answer to his problem...? 

"Oi, wake up." 

Harry opened his eyes. He was lying again on the camp bed in Ron's dingy attic 
room. The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy. Pigwidgeon was asleep 
with his head under his tiny wing. The scar on Harry's forehead was prickling. 


"You were muttering in your sleep." 

"Was I?" 

"Yeah. 'Gregorovitch.' You kept saying 'Gregorovitch.'" 

Harry was not wearing his glasses; Ron's face appeared slightly blurred. 

"Who's Gregorovitch?" 

 

"I dunno, do I?" You were the one saying it." 

Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard the name 
before, but he could not think where. 

"I think Voldemort's looking for him." 

"Poor bloke," said Ron fervently. 

Harry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to remember 
exactly what he had seen in the dream, but all that came back was a mountainous horizon 
and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley. 

"I think he's abroad." 

"Who, Gregorovitch?" 

"Voldemort. I think he's somewhere abroad, looking for Gregorovitch. It didn't 
look like anywhere in Britain." 

"You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?" 

Ron sounded worried. 

"Do me a favor and don't tell Hermione," said Harry. "Although how she expects 
me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep..." 

He gazed up at little Pigwidgeon's cage, thinking...Why was the name 
"Gregorovitch" familiar? 

"I think," he said slowly, "he's got something to do with Quidditch. There's some 
connection, but I can't--I can't think what it is." 

"Quidditch?" said Ron. "Sure you're not thinking of Gorgovitch?" 

"Who?" 

"Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record 
fee two years ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season." 

"No," said Harry. "I'm definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch." 

 

"I try not to either," said Ron. "Well, happy birthday anyway." 

"Wow -- that's right, I forgot! I'm seventeen!" 

Harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the cluttered desk 
where he had left his glasses, and said, "Accio Glasses!" Although they were only around 
a foot away, there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward 
him, at least until they poked him in the eye. 

"Slick," snorted Ron. 

Reveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron's possessions flying around 
the room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage. Harry 
also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes 
to untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron's 
Chudley Cannons posters bright blue. 


"I'd do your fly by hand, though," Ron advised Harry, sniggering when Harry 
immediately checked it. "Here's your present. Unwrap it up here, it's not for my mother's 
eyes." 

"A book?" said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. "Bit of a departure from 
tradition, isn't it?" 

"This isn't your average book," said Ron. "It'd pure gold: Twelve Fail-Safe Ways 
to Charm Witches. Explains everything you need to know about girls. If only I'd had this 
last year I'd have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I would've known how to 
get going with... Well, Fred and George gave me a copy, and I've learned a lot. You'd be 
surprised, it's not all about wandwork, either." 

When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table. 
Bill and Monsieur Delacour were finishing their breakfasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood 
chatting to them over the frying pan. 

 

"Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry," said Mrs. Weasley, 
beaming at him. "He had to leave early for work, but he'll be back for dinner. That's our 
present on top." 

Harry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped it. 
Inside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his 
seventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling around the race instead of hands. 

"It's traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age," said Mrs. 
Weasley, watching him anxiously from beside the cooker. "I'm afraid that one isn't new 
like Ron's, it was actually my brother Fabian's and he wasn't terribly careful with his 
possessions, it's a bit dented on the back, but--" 

The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He tried to put 
a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, because she patted 
his cheek clumsily when he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, 
causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor. 

"Happy birthday, Harry!" said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her 
own present to the top of the pile. "It's not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get 
him?" she added to Ron, who seemed not to hear her. 

"Come on, then, open Hermione's!" said Ron. 

She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained an 
enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur ("Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you 
will ever 'ave," Monsieur Delacour assured him, "but you must tell it clearly what you 
want...ozzerwise you might find you 'ave a leetle less hair zan you would like..."), 
chocolates from the Delacours, and an enormous box of the latest Weasleys' Wizard 
Wheezes merchandise from Fred and George. 

 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame 
Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded. 

"I'll pack these for you," Hermione said brightly, taking Harry's presents out of his 
arms as the three of them headed back upstairs. "I'm nearly done, I'm just waiting for the 
rest of your underpants to come out of the wash, Ron--" 

Ron's splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing. 

"Harry, will you come in here a moment?" 


It was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the elbow 
and tugged him on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room. 

He had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a large 
poster of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a picture of Gwenog 
Jones, Captain of the all-witch Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A 
desk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and 
Ginny had once played a two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now 
housed a large, pearly white marquee. The golden flag on top was level with Ginny's 
window. 

Ginny looked up into Harry's face, took a deep breath, and said, "Happy 
seventeenth." 

"Yeah...thanks." 

She was looking at him steadily; he however, found it difficult to look back at her; 
it was like gazing into a brilliant light. 

"Nice view," he said feebly, pointing toward with window. 

She ignored this. He could not blame her. 

"I couldn't think what to get you," she said. 

 

"You didn't have to get me anything." 

She disregarded this too. 

"I didn't know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn't be 
able to take it with you." 

He chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many 
wonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that 
having six brothers must have toughened her up. 

She took a step closer to him. 

"So then I thought, I'd like you to have something to remember me by, you know, 
if you meet some veela when you're off doing whatever you're doing." 

"I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be 
honest." 

"There's the silver lining I've been looking for," she whispered, and then she was 
kissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it 
was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, 
Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair-- 

The door banged open behind them and they jumped apart. 

"Oh," said Ron pointedly. "Sorry." 

"Ron!" Hermione was just behind him, slight out of breath. There was a strained 
silence, then Ginny had said in a flat little voice, 

"Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry." 

Ron's ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door 
in their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door 
opened, and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble. All the reasons for 
ending his relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk 
inside the room with Ron, and all happy forgetfulness was gone. 


He looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but 
she had turned her back on him. He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to 
tears. He could not do anything to comfort her in front of Ron. 

"I'll see you later," he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom. 

Ron marched downstairs, though the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and 
Harry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking 
scared. 

Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded on Harry. 

"You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?" 

"I'm not messing her around," said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them. 

"Ron--" 

But Ron held up a hand to silence her. 

"She was really cut up when you ended it--" 

"So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn't because I wanted to." 

"Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she's just going to get her hopes up 
again--" 

"She's not an idiot, she knows it can't happen, she's not expecting us to--to end up 
married, or--" 

As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry's mind of Ginny in a white dress, 
marrying a tall, faceless, and unpleasant stranger. 

 

In one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him: Her future was free and 
unencumbered, whereas his...he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead. 

"If you keep groping her every chance you get--" 

"It won't happen again," said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he felt as 
though the sun had gone in. "Okay?" 

Ron looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward and forward on his 
feet for a moment, then said, "Right then, well, that's...yeah." 

Ginny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for the rest of the day, 
nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite 
conversation in her room. Nevertheless, Charlie's arrival came as a relief to Harry. It 
provided a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand 
threateningly, and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut. 

As Harry's birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow's kitchen to breaking 
point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were 
placed end to end in the garden. Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns 
all emblazoned with a large number 17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. 
Weasley's ministrations, George's wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used 
to the dark hole in the side of his head, despite the twins' many jokes about it. 

Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and 
drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes. 

"Nice," said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione 

 

turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. "You've really got an eye for that sort of 
thing." 


"Thank you, Ron!" said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. 
Harry turned away, smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that he would find a 
chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe 
Ways to Charm Witches; he caught Ginny's eye and grinned at her before remembering 
his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour. 

"Out of the way, out of the way!" sang Mrs. Weasley, coming through the gate 
with what appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating in front of her. Seconds 
later Harry realized that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending 
with her wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground. When the cake had 
finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said, 

"That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley." 

"Oh, it's nothing, dear," she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the 
thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one. 

By seven o'clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, 
who had waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honored the occasion by 
wearing his best, and horrible, hairy brown suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook 
Harry's hand, Harry thought he looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside 
him, looked simply radiant. 

"Happy birthday, Harry," she said, hugging him tightly. 

"Seventeen, eh!" said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine from 
Fred. "Six years ter the day since we met, Harry, d'yeh remember it?" 

 

"Vaguely," said Harry, grinning up at him. "Didn't you smash down the front door, 
give Dudley a pig's tail, and tell me I was a wizard?" 

"I forge' the details," Hagrid chortled. "All righ', Ron, Hermione?" 

"We're fine," said Hermione. "How are you?" 

"Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns. I'll show yeh when yeh 
get back--" Harry avoided Ron's and Hermione's gazes as Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. 
"Here. Harry -- couldn't think what ter get teh, but then I remembered this." He pulled out 
a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn 
around the neck. "Mokeskin. Hide anythin' in there an' no one but the owner can get it out. 
They're rare, them." 

"Hagrid, thanks!" 

"'S'nothin'," said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand. "An' there's 
Charlie! Always liked him -- hey! Charlie!" 

Charlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his new, brutally short 
haircut. He was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up his 
muscley arms. 

"Hi, Hagrid, how's it going?" 

"Bin meanin' ter write fer ages. How's Norbert doin'?" 

"Norbert?" Charlie laughed. "The Norwegian Ridgeback? We call her Norberta 
now." 

"Wha -- Norbert's a girl?" 

"Oh yeah," said Charlie. 

"How can you tell?" asked Hermione. 


"They're a lot more vicious," said Charlie. He looked over his shoulder and 
dropped his voice. "Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum's getting edgy." 

 

They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour 
while glancing repeatedly at the gate. 

"I think we'd better start without Arthur," she called to the garden at large after a 
moment or two. "He must have been held up at -- oh!" 

They all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came flying across the yard 
and onto the table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel, which stood on its 
hind legs and spoke with Mr. Weasley's voice. 

"Minister of Magic coming with me." 

The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur's family peering in 
astonishment at the place where it had vanished. 

"We shouldn't be here," said Lupin at once. "Harry -- I'm sorry -- I'll explain some 
other time--" 

He seized Tonkss wrist and pulled her away; they reached the fence, climbed 
over it, and vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered. 

"The Minister -- but why--? I don't understand--" 

But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley had 
appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly 
recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair. 

The two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the lantern-lit 
table, where everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came 
within range of the lantern light. Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time 
that had met, scraggy and grim. 

"Sorry to intrude," said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table. 
"Especially as I can see that I am gate-crashing a party." 

 

His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake. 

"Many happy returns." 

"Thanks," said Harry. 

"I require a private word with you," Scrimgeour went on. "Also with Mr. Ronald 
Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger." 

"Us?" said Ron, sounding surprised. "Why us?" 

"I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private," said Scrimgeour. "Is 
there such a place?' he demanded of Mr. Weasley. 

"Yes, of course," said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. "The, er, sitting room, 
why don't you use that?" 

"You can lead the way," Scrimgeour said to Ron. "There will be no need for you 
to accompany us, Arthur." 

Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he, Ron, 
and Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew 
that the other two were thinking the same as he was; Scrimgeour must, somehow, had 
learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts. 

Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messed kitchen and into 
the Burrow's sitting room. Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, 


it was already dark in here; Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they 
illuminated the shabby but cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair 
that Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side 
by side onto the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke. 

"I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we do it 
individually. If you two" -- he pointed at Harry and Hermione -- "can wait upstairs, I will 
start with Ronald." 

 

"We're not going anywhere," said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. 
"You can speak to us together, or not at all." 

Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression that the 
Minister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early. 

"Very well then, together," he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. "I am here, 
as I'm sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore's will." 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. 

"A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you 
anything?" 

"A-all of us?" said Ron, "Me and Hermione too?" 

"Yes, all of --" 

But Harry interrupted. 

"Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give us what 
he left us?" 

"Isn't it obvious?" said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. "They wanted 
to examine whatever he's left us. You had no right to do that!" she said, and her voice 
trembled slightly. 

"I had every right," said Scrimgeour dismissively. "The Decree for Justifiable 
Confiscation gives the Ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a will--" 

"That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts," said Hermione, 
"and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased's possessions 
are illegal before seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was 
trying to pass us something cursed?" 

"Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?" asked 
Scrimgeour. 

"No, I'm not," retorted Hermione. "I'm hoping to do some good in the world!" 

Ron laughed. Scrimgeour's eyes flickered toward him and away again as Harry 
spoke. 

"So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can't think of a pretext 
to keep them?" 

"No, it'll be because thirty-one days are up," said Hermione at once. "They can't 
keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they're dangerous. Right?" 

"Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?" asked Scrimgeour, 
ignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled. 

"Me? Not -- not really... It was always Harry who..." 

Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a stop-
talking-now! sort of look, but the damage was done; Scrimgeour looked as though he had 


heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. He swooped like a bird of prey 
upon Ron's answer. 

"If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that 
he remembered you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast 
majority of his possessions -- his private library, his magical instruments, and other 
personal effects -- were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?" 

"I...dunno," said Ron. "I...when I say we weren't close...I mean, I think he liked 
me..." 

"You're being modest, Ron," said Hermione. "Dumbledore was very fond of you." 

This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron and 
Dumbledore had never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been 
negligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his 
cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. 
From it, he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud. 

"'The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore'... 
Yes, here we are... 'To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that 
he will remember me when he uses it.'" 

Scrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen before: It looked 
something like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light 
from a place, and restore it, with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed 
the Deluminator to Ron, who took it and turned it over in the fingers looking stunned. 

"That is a valuable object," said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. "It may even be 
unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore's own design. Why would he have left you and item 
so rare?" 

Ron shook his head, looking bewildered. 

"Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students," Scrimgeour persevered. 
"Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did 
he think you would put to the Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?" 

"Put out lights, I s'pose," mumbled Ron. "What else could I do with it?" 

Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or 
tow, he turned back to Dumbledore's will. 

"'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the 
Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'" 

Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the 
copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding was stained and peeling in places. 
Hermione took it from Scrimgeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and 
gazed at it. Harry saw that the title was in runes; he had never learned to read them. As he 
looked, a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols. 

"Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?" asked 
Scrimgeour. 

"He... he knew I liked books," said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping her eyes 
with her sleeve. 

"But why that particular book?" 

"I don't know. He must have thought I'd enjoy it." 

"Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages, with 
Dumbledore?" 


"No, I didn't," said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. "And if the 
Ministry hasn't found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days, I doubt that I 
will." 

She suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had 
difficulty extracting his arm to put it around Hermione's shoulders. Scrimgeour turned 
back to the will. 

"'To Harry James Potter,'" he read, and Harry's insides contracted with a sudden 
excitement, "'I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a 
reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.'" 

As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its silver wings 
fluttered rather feebly, and Harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax. 

"Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?" asked Scrimgeour. 

"No idea," said Harry. "For the reasons you just read out, I suppose... to remind 
me what you can get if you... persevere and whatever it was." 

"You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?" 

"I suppose so," said Harry. "What else could it be?" 

"I'm asking the questions," said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little closer to the 
sofa. Dusk was really falling outside now; the marquee beyond the windows towered 
ghostly white over the hedge. 

"I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch," Scrimgeour said to 
Harry. "Why is that?" 

Hermione laughed derisively. 

"Oh, it can't be a reference to the fact Harry's a great Seeker, that's way too 
obvious," she said. "There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the 
icing!" 

"I don't think there's anything hidden in the icing," said Scrimgeour, "but a Snitch 
would be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I'm sure?" 

Harry shrugged, Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought that answering 
questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge. 

"Because Snitches have flesh memories," she said. 

"What?" said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione's Quidditch 
knowledge negligible. 

"Correct," said Scrimgeour. "A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is 
released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an enchantment by which it 
can identify the first human to lay hands upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This 
Snitch" -- he held up the tiny golden ball -- "will remember your touch, Potter. 

It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill, whatever his 
other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you." 

Harry's heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrimgeour was right. How 
could he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister? 

"You don't say anything," said Scrimgeour. "Perhaps you already know what the 
Snitch contains?" 

"No," said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch without 
really doing so. If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read Hermione's 
mind; he could practically hear her brain whizzing beside him. 

"Take it," said Scrimgeour quietly. 


Harry met the Minister's yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey. He 
held out his hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and place the Snitch, slowly and 
deliberately, into Harry's palm. 

Nothing happened. As Harry's fingers closed around the Snitch, its tired wings 
fluttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Hermione continued to gaze avidly at the 
now partially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way. 

"That was dramatic," said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermione laughed. 

"That's all, then, is it?" asked Hermione, making to raise herself off the sofa. 

"Not quite," said Scrimgeour, who looked bad tempered now. "Dumbledore left 
you a second bequest, Potter." 

"What is it?" asked Harry, excitement rekindling. 

Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time. 

"The sword of Godric Gryffindor," he said. Hermione and Ron both stiffened. 
Harry looked around for a sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but Scrimgeour did not pull the 
sword from the leather pouch, which in any case looked much too small to contain it. 

"So where is it?" Harry asked suspiciously. 

"Unfortunately," said Scrimgeour, "that sword was not Dumbledore's to give 
away. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as such, 
belongs--" 

"It belongs to Harry!" said Hermione hotly. "It chose him, he was the one who 
found it, it came to him out of the Sorting Hat--" 

"According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to any 
worthy Gryffindor," said Scrimgeour. "That does not make it the exclusive property of 
Mr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore may have decided." Scrimgeour scratched his badly 
shaven cheek, scrutinizing Harry. "Why do you think--?" 

"--Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?" said Harry, struggling to keep his 
temper. "Maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall." 

"This is not a joke, Potter!" growled Scrimgeour. "Was it because Dumbledore 
believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did 
he wish to give you that sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the 
one destined to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?" 

"Interesting theory," said Harry. "Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in 
Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of wasting 
their time stripping down Deluminators or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So this 
is what you've been doing, Minister, shut up in your office, trying to break open a Snitch? 
People are dying C I was nearly one of them C Voldemort chased me across three 
countries, he killed Mad-Eye Moody, but there's no word about any of that from the 
Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!" 

"You go too far!" shouted Scrimgeour, standing up: Harry jumped to his feet too. 
Scrimgeour limped toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his 
wand; It singed a hole in Harry's T-shirt like a lit cigarette. 

"Oi!" said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said, 

"No! D'you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?" 

"Remembered you're not at school, have you?" said Scrimgeour breathing hard 
into Harry's face. "Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence 


and insubordination? You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a 
seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! It's time you learned some respect!" 

"It's time you earned it." said Harry. 

The floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door to the 
sitting room burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in. 

"We --- we thought we heard --" began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed 
at the sight of Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose. 

"raised voices," panted Mrs. Weasley. 

Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole he had 
made in Harry's T-shirt. He seemed to regret his loss of temper. 

"It C it was nothing," he growled. "I  regret your attitude," he said, looking 
Harry full in the face once more. "You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire 
what you C what Dumbledore C desired. We ought to work together." 

"I don't like your methods, Minister," said Harry. "Remember?" 

For the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour the scar 
that still showed white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell lies . Scrimgeour's 
expression hardened. He turned away without another word and limped from the room. 
Mrs. Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or 
so she called, "He's gone!" 

What did he want?" Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back to them. 

"To give us what Dumbledore left us," said Harry. "They've only just released the 
content of his will." 

Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour had 
given them were passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator 
and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to 
pass on the sword, but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore 
would have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. Weasley examined the Deluminator for the 
third of fourth time, Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, "Harry, dear, everyone's awfully 
hungry we didn't like to start without you Shall I serve dinner now?" 

They all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of "Happy Birthday" 
and much gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding 
the following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set 
up a tent for himself in a neighboring field. 

"Meet us upstairs," Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs. 
Weasley restore the garden to its normal state. "After everyone's gone to bed." 

Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid's 
mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless 
though some of them were the Marauder's Map, the shard of Sirius's enchanted mirror, 
and R.A.B.'s locket. He pulled the string tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then 
sat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped 
on the door and tiptoed inside. 

"Muffiato," she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs. 

"Thought you didn't approve of that spell?" said Ron. 

"Times change," said Hermione. "Now, show us that Deluminator." 


Ron obliged at once. Holding I up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp 
they had lit went out at once. 

"The thing is," whispered Hermione through the dark, "we could have achieved 
that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder." 

There was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the 
ceiling and illuminated them all once more. 

"Still, it's cool," said Ron, a little defensively. "And from what they said, 
Dumbledore invented it himself!" 

"I know but, surely he wouldn't have singled you out in his will just to help us 
turn out the lights!" 

"D'you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine 
everything he'd left us?" asked Harry. 

"Definitely," said Hermione. "He couldn't tell us in the will why he was leaving 
us these things, but that will doesn't explain" 

" why he couldn't have given us a hint when he was alive?" asked Ron. 

"Well, exactly," said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle the 
Bard. "If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the 
Ministry, you'd think he'd have left us know why unless he thought it was obvious?" 

"Thought wrong, then, didn't he?" said Ron. "I always said he was mental. 
Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch C what the hell was 
that about?" 

"I've no idea," said Hermione. "When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was 
so sure that something was going to happen!" 

"Yeah, well," said Harry, his pulse quickened as he raised the Snitch in his fingers. 
"I wasn't going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour was I?" 

"What do you mean?" asked Hermione. 

"The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?" said Harry. "Don't you 
remember?" 

Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing frantically 
from Harry to the Snitch and back again until he found his voice. 

"That was the one you nearly swallowed!" 

"Exactly," said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the 
Snitch. 

It did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him: He 
lowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out. 

"Writing! There's writing on it, quick, look!" 
He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Hermione was quite right. 
Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, 
were five words written in the thin, slanted handwriting that Harry recognized as 
Dumbledore's 

I open at the close. 

He had barely read them when the words vanished again. 

"I open at the close." What's that supposed to mean?" 

Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank. 

"I open at the close at the close I open at the close" 


But no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different inflections, 
they were unable to wring any more meaning from them. 

"And the sword," said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts 
to divine meaning in the Snitch's inscription. 

"Why did he want Harry to have the sword?" 

"And why couldn't he just have told me?" Harry said quietly. "I was there, it was 
right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have 
it, why didn't he just give it to me then?" 

He felt as thought he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to 
have been able to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive. Was there 
something he had missed in the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know 
what it all meant? Had Dumbledore expected him to understand? 

"And as for this book." Said Hermione, "The Tales of Beedle the Bard  I've 
never even heard of them!" 

"You've never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?" said Ron incredulously. 
"You're kidding, right?" 

"No, I'm not," said Hermione in surprise. "Do you know them then?" 

"Well, of course I do!" 

Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book that 
Hermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise. 

"Oh come on! All the old kids' stories are supposed to be Beedle's aren't they? 
'The Fountain of Fair Fortune'  'The Wizard and the Hopping Pot' 'Babbitty Rabbitty 
and her Cackling Stump'" 

"Excuse me?" said Hermione giggling. "What was the last one?" 

"Come off it!" said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione. "You 
must've heard of Babbitty Rabbitty C" 

"Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!" said 
Hermione. "We didn't hear stories like that when we were little, we heard 'Snow White 
and the Seven Dwarves' and 'Cinderella' C" 

"What's that, an illness?" asked Ron. 

"So these are children's stories?" asked Hermione, bending against over the runes. 

"Yeah." Said Ron uncertainly. "I mean, just what you hear, you know, that all 
these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what they're like in the original versions." 

"But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?" 

Something cracked downstairs. 

"Probably just Charlie, now Mum's asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair," said 
Ron nervously. 

"All the same, we should get to bed," whispered Hermione. "It wouldn't do to 
oversleep tomorrow." 

"No," agreed Ron. "A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom's mother might put a 
bit of damper on the wedding. I'll get the light." 

And he clicked the Deluminator once more as Hermione left the room. 


Chapter Eight 

The Wedding 

Three oclock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron, Fred and George 
standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the 
wedding guests. Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the 
double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery St. Catchpole, from 
whom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce 
Harry as Cousin Barny and trust to the great number of Weasley relatives to 
camouflage him. 

 All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show people 
to the right seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a 
golden jacketed band, and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance 
away under a tree. Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot. 
Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden 
chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. The supporting poles were entwined with 
white and gold flowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden 
balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and 
wife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. 
Harry was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting 
was slightly fatter than him and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a 
summers day. 

When I get married, said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, I wont 
be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and Ill put a full 
Body Bird Curse on Mum until its all over. 

 She wasnt too bad this morning, considering, said George. Cried a bit about 
Percy not being here, but who wants him. Oh blimey, brace yourselves, here they come, 
look. 

 Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one out of nowhere at the distant 
boundary of the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed, which began to snake its 
way up through the garden toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds 
fluttered on the witches hats, while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards 
cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees 
as the crowd approached the tent. 

 Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins, said George, craning his neck for a 
better look. Theyll need help understanding our English customs, Ill look after 
them. 

 Not so fast, Your Holeyness, said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-
aged witches heading for the procession, he said, Here C permetiez moi to assister 
vous, to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. 
George was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and Ron took charge of Mr. 
Weasleys old Ministry-colleague Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harrys 
lot. 

 Wotcher, said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found 
Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. 
Arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night, she added 


in a whisper as Harry led them up the aisle. The Ministrys being very anti-werewolf at 
the museum and we thought our presence might not do you any favors. 

 Its fine, I understand, said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks. Lupin 
gave him a swift smile, but as they turned away Harry saw Lupins face fall again into 
lines of misery. He did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter. 
Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption. Having misunderstood Freds 
directions as he had sat himself, not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set 
aside for him in the back row, but on five sets that now resembled a large pile of golden 
matchsticks. 

 While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to 
anybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron face-to-face 
with a most eccentric-looking wizard. Slightly cross-eyed, with shoulder-length white 
hair the texture of candyfloss, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and 
robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a 
triangular eye, glistened from a golden chain around his neck. 

 Xenophilius Lovegood, he said, extending a hand to Harry, my daughter and I 
live just over the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. But I think you know 
my Luna? he added to Ron. 

 Yes, said Ron. Isnt she with you? 

 She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a 
glorious infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise 
little gnomes C or, to give them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi. 

 Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words, said Ron, but I think Fred and 
George taught them those. 

 He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up. 

 Hello, Harry! she said. 

 Er C my names Barry, said Harry, flummoxed. 

 Oh, have you changed that too? she asked brightly. 

 How did you know -? 

 Oh, just your expression, she said. 

 Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had 
accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair. Once you get over the brightness of it all, 
the general effect was quite pleasant. At least there were no radishes dangling from her 
ears. 

 Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the 
exchange between Luna and Harry. Biding the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, 
who held up her finger and said, Daddy, look C one of the gnomes actually bit me. 

 How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial. Said Mr. Lovegood, 
seizing Lunas outstretched fingers and examining the bleeding puncture marks. Luna, 
my love, if you should feel any burgeoning talent today C perhaps an unexpected urge to 
sing opera or to declaims in Mermish C do not repress it! You may have been gifted by 
the Gernumblies! 

 Ron, passing them in the opposite direction let out a loud snort. 

 Ron can laugh, said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius toward 
their seats, but my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic. 


 Really? said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her 
fathers peculiar views. Are you sure you dont want to put anything on that bite, 
though? 

 Oh, its fine, said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking 
Harry up and down. You look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably wear 
dress robes, but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you 
know. 

 As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching 
his arm. Her beaky nose, red-rimmed eyes, and leathery pink hat gave her the look of a 
bad-tempered flamingo. 

 and your hairs much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were 
Ginevra. Merlins beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an 
omelet. And who are you? she barked at Harry. 

 Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny. 

 Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isnt Harry Potter here? I was 
hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been 
boasting? 

 No C he couldnt come C 

 Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press 
photographs, then. Ive just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara, she 
shouted at Harry. Goblin-made, you know, and been in my family for centuries. Shes a 
good-looking girl, but still C French. Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a 
hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long. 

 Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some 
time. When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their 
places. The Marquee was nearly full now and for the first time there was no queue 
outside. 

 Nightmare, Muriel is, said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve. She used 
to come for Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took offense because Fred and 
George set off a Dungbomb under her chair at diner. Dad always says shell have written 
them out of her will C like they care, theyre going to end up richer than anyone in the 
family, rate theyre going Wow, he added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came 
hurrying toward them. You look great! 

 Always the tone of surprise, said Hermione, though she smiled. She was 
wearing a floaty, lilac-colored dress with matching high heels; her hair was sleek and 
shiny. Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesnt agree, I just met her upstairs while she was 
giving Fleur the tiara. She said, Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born? and then, Bad 
posture and skinny ankles. 

 Dont take it personally, shes rude to everyone, said Ron. 

 Talking about Muriel? inquired George, reemerging from the marquee with 
Fred. Yeah, shes just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius 
was still with us, though; he was a right laugh at weddings. 

 Wasnt he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours later? asked 
Hermione. 

 Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end, conceded George. 


 But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party, said Fred. He 
used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, hoist up his 
robes, and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his C 

 Yes, he sounds a real charmer, said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter. 

 Never married, for some reason, said Ron. 

 You amaze me, said Hermione. 

 They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer, a dark-
haired young man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until he held out 
his invitation to Ron and said, with his eyes on Hermione, You look vunderful. 

 Viktor! she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made a loud 
thump quite disproportionate to its size. As she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, she 
said I didnt know you were C goodness C its lovely to see C how are you? 

 Rons ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krums invitation as if 
he did not believe a word of it, he said, much too loudly, how come youre here? 

 Fleur invited me, said Krum, eyebrows raised. 

 Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then feeling that it would 
be prudent to remove Krum from Rons vicinity, offered to show him his seat. 

 Your friend is not pleased to see me, said Krum, as they entered the now 
packed marquee. Or is he a relative? he added with a glance at Harrys red curly hair. 

 Cousin. Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. His appearance was 
causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela cousins: He was, after all, a famous 
Quidditch player. While people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, 
Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle. 

 Time to sit down, Fred told Harry, or were going to get run over by the 
bride. 

 Harry, Ron and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred and 
George. Hermione looked rather pink and Rons ears were still scarlet. After a few 
moments he muttered to Harry, Did you see hes grown a stupid little beard? 

 Harry gave a noncommittal grunt. 

 A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring 
broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the 
aisle, smiling and waving at relatives; Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of 
amethyst colored robes with a matching hat. 

 A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both 
wearing dress robes, with larger white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and 
there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as 
music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons. 

 Ooooh! said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance. 

 A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as 
Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur 
Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and 
seemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed 
everyone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny and 
Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual and once Fleur 
had reached for him, Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrit Greyback. 


 Ladies and gentlemen, said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, 
Harry saw the same small, tufty-hired wizard who had presided at Dumbledores funeral, 
now standing in front of Bill and Fleur. We are gathered here today to celebrate the 
union of two faithful souls 

 Yes, my tiara set off the whole thing nicely, said Auntie Muriel in a rather 
carrying whisper. But I must say, Ginevras dress is far too low cut. 

 Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front 
again. Harrys mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to the afternoons 
spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; 
they had always seemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shining hours 
from a normal persons life, a person without a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. 

 Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle? 

 In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly 
into scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that 
Hagrid had taken out one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned 
around and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears. 

 then I declare you bonded for life. 

 The tufty-haired wizard waved his hand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and 
a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined figures. As 
Fred and George led a round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst. Birds of 
paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their songs and 
chimes to the din. 

 Ladies and gentlemen! called the tufty-haired wizard. If you would please 
stand up! 

 They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand again. The 
scars on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the 
marquee vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a 
glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten 
gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering 
chairs grouped themselves around small, white-clothed tables, which all floated 
gracefully back to earth round it, and the golden-jacketed hand trooped toward a podium. 

 Smooth, said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides, some 
hearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky, others tottering piles of 
tarts and sandwiches. 

 We should go and congratulate them! said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see 
the place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well-wishers. 

 Well have time later, shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing 
tray and handing one to Harry. Hermione, cop hold, lets grab a table. Not there! 
Nowhere near Muriel C 

 Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as he went; 
Harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached 
the other side of the marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one 
where Luna sat alone. 

 All right if we join you? asked Ron. 

 Oh yes, she said happily. Daddys just gone to give Bill and Fleur our 
present. 


 What is it, a lifetimes supply of Gurdyroots? asked Ron. 

 Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes 
watering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments. 

 The band had begun to play, Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great 
applause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by 
Mr. Weasley and Fleurs father. 

 I like this song, said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few 
seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the 
spot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her arms. 

 Shes great isnt she? said Ron admiringly. Always good value. 

 But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had dropped into 
Lunas vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time Krum had not 
come to compliment her. With a scowl on his face he said, Who is that man in the 
yellow? 

 Thats Xenophilius Lovegood, hes the father of a friend of ours, said Ron. His 
pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the 
clear provocation. Come and dance, he added abruptly to Hermione. 

 She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into 
the growing throng on the dance floor. 

 Ah, they are together now? asked Krum, momentarily distracted. 

 Er C sort of, said Harry. 

 Who are you? Krum asked. 

 Barny Weasley. 

 They shook hands. 

 You, Barny C you know this man Lovegood well? 

 No, I only met him today. Why? 

 Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting 
to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor. 

 Because, said Krum, If he vus not a guest of Fleurs I vould dud him, here and 
now, for veering that filthy sign upon his chest. 

 Sign? said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular eye 
was gleaming on his chest. Why? Whats wrong with it? 

 Grindelvald. That is Grindelvalds sign. 

 Grindelwald the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated? 

 Exactly. 

 Krums jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said, Grindelvald 
killed many people, my grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos never powerful in 
this country, they said he feared Dumbledore C and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. 
But this C he pointed a finger at Xenophilius C this is his symbol, I recognized it at 
vunce: Grindelvald carved it into a vall at Durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there. Some 
idiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to shock, make themselves 
impressive C until those of us who had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them 
better. 

 Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius. Harry felt 
perplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that Lunas father was a supporter of the Dark 
Arts, and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, finlike shape. 


 Are you C er C quite sure its Grindelwalds -? 

 I am not mistaken, said Krum coldly. I walked past that sign for several years, 
I know it vell. 

 Well, theres a chance, said Harry, that Xenophilius doesnt actually know 
what the symbol means, the Lovegoods are quite unusual. He could have easily picked 
it up somewhere and think its a cross section of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack 
or something. 

 The cross section of a vot? 

 Well, I dont know what they are, but apparently he and his daughter go on 
holiday looking for them. 

 Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father. 

 Thats her, he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing alone, waving her 
arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges. 

 Vy is she doing that? asked Krum. 

 Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt, said Harry, who recognized the 
symptoms. 

 Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him. He 
drew his hand from inside his robe and tapped it menacingly on his thighs; sparks flew 
out of the end. 

 Gregorovitch! said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too excited 
to care; the memory had come back to him at the sight of Krums wand: Ollivander 
taking it and examining it carefully before the Triwizard Tournament. 

 Vot about him? asked Krum suspiciously. 

 Hes a wandmaker! 

 I know that, said Krum. 

 He made your wand! Thats why I thought C Quidditch C 

 Krum was looking more and more suspicious. 

 How do you know Gregorovitch made my wand? 

 II read it somewhere, I think, said Harry. In a C a fan magazine, he 
improvised wildly and Krum looked mollified. 

 I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans, he said. 

 So er where is Gregorowitch these days? 

 Krum looked puzzled. 

 He retired several years ago. I was one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch 
vand. They are the best Calthough I know, of course, that your Britons set much store by 
Ollivander. 

 Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but he was 
thinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker and Harry did not 
have to search far for a reason. It was surely because of what Harry wand had done on 
the night that Voldemort pursued him across the skies. The holly and phoenix feather 
wand had conquered the borrowed wand, some thing that Ollivander had not anticipated 
or understood. Would Gregorowitch know better? Was he truly more skilled than 
Ollivander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not? 

 This girl is very nice-looking, Krum said, recalling Harry to his surroundings. 
Krum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna. She is also a relative of yours? 


 Yeah, said Harry, suddenly irritated, and shes seeing someone. Jealous type. 
Big bloke. You wouldnt want to cross him. 

 Krum grunted. 

 Vot, he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, is the point of 
being an international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken? 

 And he strode off leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and 
make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell 
him about Gregorovitch, but he was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor. 
Harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now 
dancing with Fred and Georges friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the 
promise he had given Ron. 

 He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wizarding 
celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the latter would 
not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the 
cake was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. As 
the evening drew in, and moths began to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating 
golden lanterns, the revelry became more and more uncontained. Fred and George had 
long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleurs cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, 
and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing Odo the Hero in the corner. 

 Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Rons who 
seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting 
alone at a table. His cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion 
clock and was topped by a moth-eaten fez. He was vaguely familiar: Racking his brains, 
Harry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix 
and the writer of Dumbledores obituary. 

 Harry approached him. 

 May I sit down? 

 Of course, of course, said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched, wheezy voice. 

 Harry leaned in. 

 Mr. Doge, Im Harry Potter. 

 Doge gasped. 

 My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised. I am so glad, so 
honored! 

 In a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne. 

 I thought of writing to you, he whispered, after Dumbledore the shock 
and for you, I am sure 

 Doges tiny eyes filled with sudden tears. 

 I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet, said Harry. I didnt realize 
you knew Professor Dumbledore so well. 

 As well as anyone, said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin. Certainly I 
knew him longest, if you dont count Aberforth C and somehow, people never do seem to 
count Aberforth. 

 Speaking of the Daily Prophet I dont know whether you saw, Mr. Doge -? 

 Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy. 

 Elphias, I dont know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about 
Dumbledore? 


 Doges face flooded with angry color. 

 Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might be a more accurate term, 
positively pestered me to talk to her, I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude, 
called her an interfering trout, which resulted, as you my have seen, in aspersions cast 
upon my sanity. 

 Well, in that interview, Harry went on, Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor 
Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he was young. 

 Dont believe a word of it! said Doge at once. Not a word, Harry! Let nothing 
tarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore! 

 Harry looked into Doges earnest, pained face, and felt, not reassured, but 
frustrated. Did Doge really think it was that easy, that Harry could simply choose not to 
believe? Didnt Doge understand Harrys need to be sure, to know everything? 

 Perhaps Doge suspected Harrys feelings, for he looked concerned and hurried on, 
Harry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful C 

 But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle. 

 Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her! 

 Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes 
dancing on her hair, a goblet of champagne in her hand. Shes written a book about 
Dumbledore, you know! 

Hello, Muriel, said Doge, Yes, we were just discussing C 

 You there! Give me your chair, Im a hundred and seven! 

 Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, looking alarmed, and 
Auntie Muriel swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it 
between Doge and Harry. 

 Hello again, Barry or whatever your name is, she said to Harry, Now what 
were you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know, shes written a biography of 
Dumbledore? I cant wait to read it. I must remember to place an order at Flourish and 
Blotts! 

 Doge looked stiff and solemn at this but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet and 
clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement. She took another large 
gulp of champagne, belched and then said, Theres no need to look like a pair of stuffed 
frogs! Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some 
mighty funny rumors about Albus! 

 Ill-informed sniping, said Doge, turning radish-colored again. 

 You would say that, Elphias, cackled Auntie Muriel. I noticed how you skated 
over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours! 

 Im sorry you think so, said Doge, more coldly still. I assure you I was writing 
from the heart. 

 Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay youll still think he was 
a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister! 

 Muriel! exclaimed Doge. 

 A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through 
Harrys chest. 

 What do you mean? he asked Muriel. Who said his sister was a Squib? I 
thought she was ill? 


 Thought wrong, then, didnt you, Barry! said Auntie Muriel, looking delighted 
at the effect she had produced. Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about 
it! IT all happened years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the 
truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened. Thats 
why I cant wait to find out what Skeeters unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his 
quiet for a long time! 

 Untrue! wheezed Doge, Absolutely untrue! 

 He never told me his sister as a Squib, said Harry, without thinking, still cold 
inside. 

 And why on earth would he tell you? screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her 
seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry. 

 The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana, began Elphias in a voice stiff with 
emotion, is, I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her death C 

 Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias? squawked Muriel, Why did half of us 
never even know she existed, until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a 
funeral for her? Where was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off 
being brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind what was going on in his own house! 

 What dyou mean, locked in the cellar? asked Harry. What is this? 

 Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry. 

 Dumbledores mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, 
though I heard she pretended otherwise- 

 She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman, whispered 
Doge miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored him. 

 - proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been mortified 
to produce a Squib- 

 Ariana was not a Squib! wheezed Doge. 

 So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hogwarts! said 
Auntie Muriel. She turned back to Harry. In our day, Squibs were often hushed up, 
thought to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and 
pretending she didnt exist C 

 I tell you, thats not what happened! said Doge, but Auntie Muriel 
steamrollered on, still addressing Harry. 

 Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate 
into the Muggle community much kinder than trying to find them a place in the 
Wizarding world, where they must always be second class, but naturally Kendra 
Dumbledore wouldnt have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle school C 

 Ariana was delicate! said Doge desperately. Her health was always too poor to 
permit her C 

 - to permit her to leave the house? cackled Muriel. And yet she was never 
taken to St. Mungos and no Healer was ever summoned to see her! 

 Really, Muriel, how can you possibly know whether C 

 For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. Mungos 
at the time, and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen 
there. All most suspicious, Lancelot thought! 

 Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, who seemed to be 
enjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for more champagne. Numbly Harry 


thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, locked him away, kept him out of 
sight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledores sister suffered the same fate 
in reverse: imprisoned for her lack of magic? And had Dumbledore truly left her to her 
fate while he went off to Hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented? 

 Now, if Kendra hadnt died first, Muriel resumed, Id have said that it was she 
who finished off Ariana C 

 How can you, Muriel! groaned Doge. A mother kill her own daughter? Think 
what youre saying! 

 If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on 
end, why not? shrugged Auntie Muriel. But as I say, it doesnt fit, because Kendra died 
before Ariana C of what, nobody ever seemed sure- 

 Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in 
the struggle, said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. Shake your head all you like, Elphias. 
You were at Arianas funeral, were you not? 

 Yes I was, said Doge, through trembling lips, and a more desperately sad 
occasion I cannot remember. Albus was heartbroken- 

 His heart wasnt the only thing. Didnt Aberforth break Albus nose halfway 
through the service? 

 If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked now. 
Muriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, 
which dribbled down her chin. 

 How do you -? croaked Doge. 

 My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot, said Auntie Muriel happily. 
Bathilda described the whole thing to mother while I was listening at the door. A 
coffin-side brawl. The way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus fault 
that Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did 
not even defend himself, and thats odd enough in itself. Albus could have destroyed 
Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back. 

 Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of those old scandals 
seemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge. Harry did not know what to think, 
what to believe. He wanted the truth and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly 
that Ariana had been ill. Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have 
intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house, and yet there was 
undoubtedly something odd about the story. 

 And Ill tell you something else, Muriel said, hiccupping slightly as she lowered 
her goblet. I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter. All those hints in 
Skeeters interview about an important source close to the Dumbledores C goodness 
knows she was there all through the Ariana business, and it would fit! 

 Bathilda, would never talk to Rita Skeeter! whispered Doge. 

 Bathilda Bagshot? Harry said. The author of A History of Magic? 

 The name was printed on the front of one of Harrys textbooks, though admittedly 
not one of the ones he had read more attentively. 

 Yes, said Doge, clutching at Harrys question like a drowning man at a life heir. 
A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albuss. 

 Quite gaga these days, Ive heard, said Auntie Muriel cheerfully. 


 If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of 
her, said Doge, and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said! 

 Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and Im sure Rita Skeeter knows 
them all, said Auntie Muriel But even if Bathildas completely cuckoo, Im sure shed 
still have old photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years. 
Well worth a trip to Godrics Hollow, Id have thought. 

 Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge banged him on the 
back as Harry coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming eyes. Once he had 
control of his voice again, he asked, Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godrics Hollow? 

 Oh yes, shes been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there after Percival 
was imprisoned, and she was their neighbor. 

 The Dumbledores lived in Godrics Hollows? 

 Yes, Barry, thats what I just said, said Auntie Muriel testily. 

 Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told Harry 
that they had both lived and lost loved ones in Godrics Hollow. Why? Were Lily and 
James buried close to Dumbledores mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their 
graves, perhaps walked past Lilys and Jamess to do so? And he had never once told 
Harry  never bothered to say 

 And why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to himself, yet he felt 
it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these 
experiences in common. He stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on 
around him, and did not realize that Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she 
drew up a chair beside him. 

 I simply cant dance anymore, she panted, slipping of one of her shoes and 
rubbing the sole of her foot. Rons gone looking to find more butterbeers. Its a bit odd. 
Ive just seen Viktor storming away from Lunas father, it looked like theyd been 
arguing C She dropped her voice, staring at him. Harry, are you okay? 

 Harry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter, at that moment, 
something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. 
Graceful and gleaming, the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. 
Heads turned, as those nearest it froze absurdly in mid-dance. Then the Patronuss mouth 
opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt. 

 The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming. 

Chapter Nine 

A Place to Hide 

 

Everything seemed fuzzy, slow. Harry and Hermione jumped to their feet and 
drew their wands. Many people were only just realizing that something strange had 
happened; heads were still turning toward the silver cat as it vanished. Silence spread 
outward in cold ripples from the place where the Patronus had landed. Then somebody 
screamed. 

 Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd. Guests were 
sprinting in all directions; many were Disapparating; the protective enchantments around 
the Burrow had broken. 


 Ron! Hermione cried. Ron, where are you? 

 As they pushed their way across the dance floor, Harry saw cloaked and masked 
figures appearing in the crowd; then he saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and 
heard both of them shout, Protego!, a cry that was echoed on all sides C 

 Ron! Ron! Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry were buffered by 
terrified guests: Harry seized her hand to make sure they werent separated as a streak of 
light whizzed over their heads, whether a protective charm or something more sinister he 
did not know C 

 And then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermiones free arm, and Harry felt 
her turn on the spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; 
all he could feel was Hermiones hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away 
from the Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from 
Voldemort himself. . . . 

 Where are we? said Rons voice. 

 Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not left the wedding 
after all; They still seemed to be surrounded by people. 

 Tottenham Court Road, panted Hermione. Walk, just walk, we need to find 
somewhere for you to change. 

 Harry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide dark street 
thronged with late-night revelers and lined with closed shops, stars twinkling above them. 
A double-decker bus rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they 
passed; Harry and Ron were still wearing dress robes. 

 Hermione, we havent got anything to change into, Ron told her, as a young 
woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him. 

 Why didnt I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me? said Harry, 
inwardly cursing his own stupidity. All last year I kept it on me and C 

 Its okay, Ive got the Cloak, Ive got clothes for both of you, said Hermione, 
Just try and act naturally until C this will do. 

 She led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway. 

 When you say youve got the Cloak, and clothes . . . said Harry, frowning at 
Hermione, who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which she was 
now rummaging. 

 Yes, theyre here, said Hermione, and to Harry and Rons utter astonishment, 
she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally the silvery 
Invisibility Cloak. 

 How the ruddy hell C ? 

 Undetectable Extension Charm, said Hermione. Tricky, but I think Ive done it 
okay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here. She gave the fragile-looking 
bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled 
around inside it. Oh, damn, thatll be the books, she said, peering into it, and I had 
them all stacked by subject. . . . Oh well. . . . Harry, youd better take the Invisibility 
Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change. . . . 

 When did you do all this? Harry asked as Ron stripped off his robes. 

 I told you at the Burrow, Ive had the essentials packed for days, you know, in 
case we needed to make a quick getaway. I packed your rucksack this morning, Harry, 
after you changed, and put it in here. . . . I just had a feeling. . . . 


 Youre amazing, you are, said Ron, handing her his bundled-up robes. 

 Thank you, said Hermione, managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into 
the bag. Please, Harry, get that Cloak on! 

 Harry threw his Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his 
head, vanishing from sight. He was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened. 

 The others C everybody at the wedding C 

 We cant worry about that now, whispered Hermione. Its you theyre after, 
Harry, and well just put everyone in even more danger by going back. 

 Shes right, said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was about to argue, even 
if he could not see his face. Most of the Order was there, theyll look after everyone. 

 Harry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him, and said, Yeah. 
But he thought of Ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach. 

 Come on, I think we ought to keep moving, said Hermione. 

 They moved back up the side street and onto the main road again, where a group 
of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement. 

 Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road? Ron asked Hermione. 

 Ive no idea, it just popped into my head, but Im sure were safer out in the 
Muggle world, its not where theyll expect us to be. 

 True, said Ron, looking around, but dont you feel a bit C exposed? 

 Where else is there? asked Hermione, cringing as the men on the other side of 
the road started wolf-whistling at her. We can hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron, 
can we? And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there. . . . I suppose we could try 
my parents home, though I think theres a chance they might check there. . . . Oh, I wish 
theyd shut up! 

 All right, darling? the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling. 
Fancy a drink? Ditch ginger and come and have a pint! 

 Lets sit down somewhere, Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his mouth to 
shout back across the road. Look, this will do, in here! 

 It was a small and shabby all-night caf. A light layer of grease lay on all the 
Formica-topped tables, but it was at least empty. Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron 
sat next to him opposite Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it: 
She glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch. Harry did not 
like being stationary; walking had given the illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the 
Cloak he could feel the last vestiges of Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their 
usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again. 

 After a minute or two, Ron said, You know, were not far from the Leaky 
Cauldron here, its only in Charing Cross C 

 Ron, we cant! said Hermione at once. 

 Not to stay there, but to find out whats going on! 

 We know whats going on! Voldemorts taken over the Ministry, what else do 
we need to know? 

 Okay, okay, it was just an idea! 
They relapsed into a prickly silence. The gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and 
Hermione ordered two cappuccinos: As Harry was invisible, it would have looked odd to 
order him one. A pair of burly workmen entered the caf and squeezed into the next 
booth. Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper. 


 I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside. Once 
were there, we could send a message to the Order. 

 Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then? asked Ron. 

 Ive been practicing and I think so, said Hermione. 

 Well, as long as it doesnt get them into trouble, though they mightve been 
arrested already. God, thats revolting, Ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish 
coffee. The waitress had heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the 
new customers orders. The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, 
now that Harry came to look at him, waved her away. She stared, affronted. 

 Lets get going, then, I dont want to drink this muck, said Ron. Hermione, 
have you got Muggle money to pay for this? 

 Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow. Ill 
bet all the change is at the bottom, sighed Hermione, reaching for her beaded bag. 

 The two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them without 
conscious thought: All three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in 
realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto 
her bench. The force of the Death Eaters spells shattered the tiled wall where Rons head 
had just been, as Harry, still invisible, yelled, Stupefy! 

 The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: He slumped 
sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired 
another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot C 
the waitress screamed and ran for the door C Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the 
Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded 
on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door. 

 Expulso! bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was 
standing blew up: The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his 
wand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him. 

 Petrificus Totalus! screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the Death Eater 
fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, 
and coffee. Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass 
ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over. 

 D-diffindo, she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as she 
slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. Oh, Im so sorry, Ron, my hands 
shaking! Diffindo! 

 The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to regain 
feeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the 
large blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench. 

 I shouldve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died, he said. 
He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot; the mans eyes moved rapidly 
between Harry, Ron and Hermione. 

 Thats Dolohov, said Ron. I recognize him from the old wanted posters. I think 
the big ones Thorfinn Rowle. 

 Never mind what theyre called! said Hermione a little hysterically. How did 
they find us? What are we going to do? 

 Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harrys head. 

 Lock the door, he told her, and Ron, turn out the lights. 


 He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and 
Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the caf into darkness. Harry could hear the men 
who had jeered at Hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance. 

 What are we going to do with them? Ron whispered to Harry through the dark; 
then, even more quietly, Kill them? Theyd kill us. They had a good go just now. 

 Hermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook his head. 

 We just need to wipe their memories, said Harry. Its better like that, itll 
throw them off the scent. If we killed them itd be obvious we were here. 

 Youre the boss, said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. But Ive never down 
a Memory Charm. 

 Nor have I, said Hermione, but I know the theory. 

 She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolohovs forehead 
and said, Obliviate. 

 At once, Dolohovs eyes became unfocused and dreamy. 

 Brilliant! said Harry, clapping her on the back. Take care of the other one and 
the waitress while Ron and I clear up. 
Clear up? said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed caf. Why? 

 Dont you think they might wonder whats happened if they wake up and find 
themselves in a place that looks like its just been bombed? 

 Oh right, yeah . . . 

 Ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket. 

 Its no wonder I cant get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, theyre 
tight. 

 Oh, Im so sorry, hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the waitress out of sight 
of the windows, Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where Ron could stick his 
wand instead. 

 Once the caf was restored to its previous condition, they heaved the Death Eaters 
back into their booth and propped them up facing each other. But how did they find us? 
Hermione asked, looking from one inert man to the other. How did they know where we 
were? 

 She turned to Harry. 

 You C you dont think youve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry? 

 He cant have, said Ron. The Trace breaks at seventeen, thats Wizarding law, 
you cant put it on an adult. 

 As far as you know, said Hermione. What if the Death Eaters have found a 
way to put it on a seventeen-year-old? 

 But Harry hasnt been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours. Whos 
supposed to have put a Trace back on him? 

 Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted: Was that really how the 
Death Eaters had found them? 

 If I cant use magic, and you cant use magic near me, without us giving away 
our position C  he began. 

 Were not splitting up! said Hermione firmly. 

 We need a safe place to hide, said Ron. Give us time to think things through. 

 Grimmauld Place, said Harry. 

 The other two gaped. 


 Dont be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there! 

 Rons dad said theyve put up jinxes against him C and even if they havent 
worked, he pressed on as Hermione began to argue so what? I swear, Id like nothing 
better than to meet Snape! 

 But C 

 Hermione, where else is there? Its the best chance weve got. Snapes only one 
Death Eater. If Ive still got the Trace on me, well have whole crowds of them on us 
wherever else we go. 

 She could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked to. While she 
unlocked the caf door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the cafs light. Then, on 
Harrys count of three, they reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the 
waitress or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron and 
Hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more. 

 Seconds later Harrys lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes: They 
were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. Tall, dilapidated 
houses looked down on them from every side. Number twelve was visible to them, for 
they had been told of its existence by Dumbledore, its Secret-Keeper, and they rushed 
toward it, checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed. They 
raced up the stone steps, and Harry tapped the front door once with his wand. They heard 
a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the door swung open with a 
creak and they hurried over the threshold. 

 As Harry closed the door behind them, the old-fashioned gas lamps sprang into 
life, casting flickering light along the length of the hallway. It looked just as Harry 
remembered it: eerie, cobwebbed, the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall 
throwing odd shadows up the staircase. Long dark curtains concealed the portrait of 
Siriuss mother. The only thing that was out of place was the trolls leg umbrella stand, 
which was lying on its side as if Tonks had just knocked it over again. 

 I think somebodys been in here, Hermione whispered, pointing toward it. 

 That couldve happened as the Order left, Ron murmured back. 

 So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape? Harry asked. 

 Maybe theyre only activated if he shows up? suggested Ron. 

 Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door, scared 
to move farther into the house. 

 Well, we cant stay here forever, said Harry, and he took a step forward. 

 Severus Snape? 

 Mad-Eye Moodys voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three of them 
jump back in fright. Were not Snape! croaked Harry, before something whooshed over 
him like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak. 
Before he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again. 

 The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. Ron 
was making retching noises; Hermione stammered, That m-must have b-been the T-
Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for Snape! 

 Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the shadows at 
the end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up 
out of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and terrible; Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. 
Black, her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, 


its waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty 
eye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at 
Harry. 

 No! Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. 
No! It wasnt us! We didnt kill you C 

 On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust: Coughing, his eyes 
watering, Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with 
her arms over her head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her 
clumsily on the shoulder and saying, Its all r-right. . . . Its g-gone. . . . 

 Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs. Black 
continued to scream. 

 Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers C 

 SHUT UP! Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang and a 
burst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her. 

 That . . . that was . . .  Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet. 

 Yeah, said Harry, but it wasnt really him, was it? Just something to scare 
Snape. 
Had it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-figure 
aside as casually as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led the 
other two up the hall, half-expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved 
except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board. 

 Before we go any farther, I think wed better check, whispered Hermione, and 
she raised her wand and said, Homenum revelio. 

 Nothing happened. 

 Well, youve just had a big shock, said Ron kindly. What was that supposed to 
do? 

 It did what I meant it to do! said Hermione rather crossly. That was a spell to 
reveal human presence, and theres nobody here except us! 
And old Dusty, said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-
figure had risen. 

 Lets go up, said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led 
the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor. 

 Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in 
the drafty room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron 
crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch. 

 Cant see anyone out there, he reported. And youd think, if Harry still had a 
Trace on him, theyd have followed us here. I know they cant get in the house, but C 
whats up, Harry? 

 Harry had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned against as something flashed 
across his mind like a bright light on water. He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that 
was not his own pound through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock. 

 What did you see? Ron asked, advancing on Harry. Did you see him at my 
place? 

 No, I just felt anger C hes really angry C 

 But that could be at the Burrow, said Ron loudly. What else? Didnt you see 
anything? Was he cursing someone? 


 No, I just felt anger C I couldnt tell C 

 Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in a 
frightened voice, Your scar, again? But whats going on? I thought that connection had 
closed! 

 It did, for a while, muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, which made it hard 
to concentrate. I C I think its started opening again whenever he loses control, thats 
how it used to C 

 But then youve got to close your mind! said Hermione shrilly. Harry, 
Dumbledore didnt want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, thats 
why you were supposed to use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images 
in your mind, remember C 

 Yeah, I do remember, thanks, said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need 
Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between 
them to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Siriuss death. He wished that he 
had not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as 
though he were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was 
building and he fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick. 

 He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry 
of the Black family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again 
and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land 
upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the 
voice of Rons father. 

 Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched. 

 The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper 
and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him, gripping his arm. 

 Theyre all right, theyre all right! she whispered, and Ron half laughed and 
hugged her. 

 Harry, he said over Hermiones shoulder, I C 

 Its not a problem, said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. Its your 
family, course you were worried. Id feel the same way. He thought of Ginny. I do feel 
the same way. 

 The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had back in the garden of 
the Burrow. Faintly he heard Hermione say I dont want to be on my own. Could we use 
the sleeping bags Ive brought and camp in here tonight? 

 He heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer. He had to succumb. 

 Bathroom, he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could without running. 

 He barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped 
his pounding head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that 
did not belong to him possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the giant 
blond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing 
over him, wand outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice. 

 More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not 
sure that he will forgive this time. . . . You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry 
Potter has escaped again? Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure. . . . Do it, 
or feel my wrath yourself! 


 A log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting across a terrified, pointed 
white face C with a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving breaths and 
opened his eyes. 

 He was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose inches from one of 
the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. He sat up. Malfoys gaunt, 
petrified face seemed burned on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had 
seen, by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort. 

 There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermiones voice rang 
out. 

 Harry, do you want your toothbrush? Ive got it here. 

 Yeah, great, thanks, he said, fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to 
let her in. 

 

Chapter Ten 

Kreachers Tale 

Harry woke early next morning, wrapped in a sleeping bag on the drawing room 
floor. A chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains. It was the cool, clear blue 
of watered ink, somewhere between night and dawn, and everything was quiet except for 
Ron and Hermiones slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they 
made on the floor beside him. Ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that Hermione 
sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above his. Her arm 
curved to the floor, her fingers inches from Rons. Harry wondered whether they had 
fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made him feel strangely lonely. 

 He looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chandelier. Less than 
twenty-four house ago, he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the 
marquee, waiting to show in wedding guests. It seemed a lifetime away. What was going 
to happen now? He lay on the floor and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting 
complex mission Dumbledore had left him Dumbledore 

 The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledores death felt different now. 
The accusations he had heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his 
brain like diseased things, infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized. Could 
Dumbledore have let such things happen? Had he been like Dudley, content to watch 
neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him? Could he have turned his back on a 
sister who was being imprisoned and hidden? 

 Harry thought of Godrics Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had never mentioned 
there; he thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in Dumbledores will, 
and resentment swelled in the darkness. Why hadnt Dumbledore told him? Why hadnt 
he explained? Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been 
nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed, but not trusted, never confided in? 

 Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company. 
Desperate for something to do, for distraction, he slipped out of his sleeping bad, picked 
up his wand, and crept out of the room. On the landing he whispered, Lumos, and 
started to climb the stairs by wandlight. 


 On the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron had slept last time 
they had been here; he glanced into it. The wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes 
had been ripped back. Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody 
had searched the house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had 
pilfered plenty from this house both before and after Sirius died? Harrys gaze wandered 
to the portrait that sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Siriuss great-great 
grandfather, but it was empty, showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop. Phineas 
Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmasters study at Hogwarts. 

 Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing where there 
were only two doors. The one facing him bore a nameplate reading Sirius. Harry had 
never entered his godfathers bedroom before. He pushed open the door, holding his 
wand high to cast light as widely as possible. The room was spacious and must once have 
been handsome. There was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window 
obscured by long velvet curtains and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle 
scrubs still resting in its sockets, solid wax banging in frostlike drips. A fine film of dust 
covered the pictures on the walls and the beds headboard; a spiders web stretched 
between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as Harry moved 
deeper into the room, he head a scurrying of disturbed mice. 

 The teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that 
little of the walls silvery-gray silk was visible. Harry could only assume that Siriuss 
parents had been unable to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the 
wall because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest sons taste in 
decoration. Sirius seemed to have long gone out of his way to annoy his parents. There 
were several large Gryffindor banners, faded scarlet and gold just to underline his 
difference from all the rest of the Slytherin family. There were many pictures of Muggle 
motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Siriuss nerve) several posters of bikini-clad 
Muggle girls. Harry could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite 
stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This 
was in contrast the only Wizarding photograph on the walls which was a picture of four 
Hogwarts students standing arm in arm, laughing at the camera. 

 With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father, his untidy black hair stuck 
up at the back like Harrys, and he too wore glasses. Beside him was Sirius, carelessly 
handsome, his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever 
seen it alive. To Siriuss right stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and 
watery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs, with the 
much-admired rebels that James and Sirius had been. On Jamess left was Lupin, even 
then a little shabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding 
himself liked and included or was it simply because Harry knew how it had been, that he 
saw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from the wall; it was his now, after all, 
Sirius had left him everything, but it would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in 
preventing his parents from redecorating his room. 

 Harry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was growing brightest. A shaft 
of light revealed bits of paper, books, and small objects scattered over the carpet. 
Evidently Siriuss bedroom had been reached too, although its contents seemed to have 
been judged mostly, if not entirely, worthless. A few of the books had been shaken 
roughly enough to part company with the covers and sundry pages littered the floor. 


 Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and examined them. He 
recognized one as a part of an old edition of A History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot, 
and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was 
handwritten and crumpled. He smoothed it out. 

 

 Dear Padfoot, 

 Thank you, thank you, for Harrys birthday present! It was his favorite by 
far. One year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased 
with himself. Im enclosing a picture so you can see. You know it only rises about two feet 
off the ground but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent 
me for Christmas (no complaints there). Of course James thought it was so funny, says 
hes going to be a great Quidditch player but weve had to pack away all the ornaments 
and make sure we dont take our eyes off him when he gets going. 

 We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda who has always been 
sweet to us and who dotes on Garry. We were so sorry you couldnt come, but the 
Orders got to come first, and Harrys not old enough to know its his birthday anyway! 
James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell C also 
Dumbledores still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions. If you 
could visit, it would cheer him up so much. Wormy was here last weekend. I thought he 
seemed down, but that was probably the next about the McKinnons; I cried all evening 
when I heard. 

 Bathilda drops in most days, shes a fascinating old thing with the most amazing 
stories about Dumbledore. Im not sure hed be pleased if he knew! I dont know how 
much to believe, actually because it seems incredible that Dumbledore 

 

 Harrys extremities seemed to have gone numb. He stood quite still, holding the 
miraculous paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet eruptions sent 
joy and grief thundering its equal measure through his veins. Lurching to the bed, he sat 
down. 

 He read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning than he had done 
the first time, and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself. She had made her gs 
the same way he did. He searched through the letter for every one of them, and each felt 
like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil. The letter was an incredible 
treasure, proof that Lily Potter had lived, really lived, that her warm hand had once 
moved across this parchment, tracing ink into these letters, these words, words about him, 
Harry, her son. 

 Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he reread the letter, this time 
concentrating on the meaning. It was like listening to a half-remembered voice. 

 They had a cat perhaps it had perished, like his parents at Godrics Hollow or 
else fled when there was nobody left to feed it Sirius had bought him his first 
broomstick His parents had known Bathilda Bagshot; had Dumbledore introduced 
them? Dumbledores still got his Invisibility Cloak there was something funny there 

 Harry paused, pondering his mothers words. Why had Dumbledore taken 
Jamess Invisibility Cloak? Harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years 
before, I dont need a cloak to become invisible Perhaps some less gifted Order 


member had needed its assistance, and Dumbledore had acted as a carrier? Harry passed 
on 

 Wormy was here Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed down had he? Was he 
aware that he was seeing James and Lily alive for the last time? 

 And finally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories about Dumbledore. It 
seems incredible that Dumbledore --- 

 That Dumbledore what? But there were any number of things that would seem 
incredible about Dumbledore; that he had once received bottom marks in a 
Transfiguration test, for instance or had taken up goat charming like Aberforth 

 Harry got to his feet and scanned the floor: Perhaps the rest of the letter was here 
somewhere. He seized papers, treating them in his eagerness, with as little consideration 
as the original searcher, he pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run 
his hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair. 

 At last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what looked like a torn piece of 
paper under the chest of drawers. When he pulled it out, it proved to be most of the 
photograph that Lily had described in her letter. A black-haired baby was zooming in and 
out of the picture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that must have 
belonged to James was chasing after him. Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket 
with Lilys letter and continued to look for the second sheet. 

 After another quarter of an hour, however he was forced to conclude that the rest 
of his mothers letter was gone. Had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had 
elapsed since it had been written, or had it been taken by whoever had searched the 
room? Harry read the first sheet again, this time looking for clues as to what might have 
made the second sheet valuable. His toy broomstick could hardly be considered 
interesting to the Death Eaters The only potentially useful thing he could see her was 
possible information on Dumbledore. It seems incredible that Dumbledore C what? 

 Harry? Harry? Harry! 

Im here! he called, Whats happened? 

There was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione burst inside. 

We woke up and didnt know where you were! she said breathlessly. She turned 
and shouted over her shoulder, Ron! Ive found him 

Rons annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below. 

Good! Tell him from me hes a git! 

Harry dont just disappear, please, we were terrified! Why did you come up here 
anyway? She gazed around the ransacked room. What have you been doing? 

Look what Ive just found 

He held out his mothers letter. Hermione took it out and read it while Harry 
watched her. When she reached the end of the page she looked up at him. 

Oh Harry 
And theres this too 

He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby zooming in 
and out of sight on the toy broom. 

Ive been looking for the rest of the letter, Harry said, but its not here. 

Hermione glanced around. 

Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here? 

Someone had searched before me, said Harry. 


I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed. What 
were they after, do you think? 

Information on the Order, if it was Snape. 

But youd think hed already have all he needed. I mean was in the Order, wasnt 
he? 

Well then, said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, what about information on 
Dumbledore? The second page of the letter, for instance. You know this Bathilda my 
mum mentions, you know who she is? 

Who? 

Bathilda Bagshot, the author of C 

A History of Magic, said Hermione, looking interested. So your parents knew 
her? She was an incredible magic historian. 

And shes still alive, said Harry, and she lives in Godrics Hollow. Rons 
Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledores family too. 
Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldnt she? There was a little too much understanding 
in the smile Hermione gave him for Harrys liking. He took back the letter and the 
photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck, so as not to have to look at 
her and give himself away. I understand why youd love to talk to her about your mum 
and dad, and Dumbledore too, said Hermione. But that wouldnt really help us in our 
search for the Horcruxes, would it? Harry did not answer, and she rushed on, Harry, I 
know you really want to go to Godrics Hollow, but Im scared. Im scared at how easily 
those Death Eaters found us yesterday. It just makes me feel more than ever that we 
ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried, Im sure theyd be expecting you 
to visit it. 

Its not just that, Harry said, still avoiding looking at her, Muriel said stuff 
about Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth 

 He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him. When he had finished, 
Hermione said, Of course, I can see why thats upset you, Harry C 

 Im not upset, he lied, Id just like to know whether or not its true or C 

 Harry do you really think youll get the truth from a malicious old woman like 
Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter? How can you believe them? You knew Dumbledore! 

 I thought I did, he muttered. 

 But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you! 
Doge is right, how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore? 

 He looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt. There it was again: 
Choose what to believe. He wanted the truth. Why was everybody so determined that he 
should not get it? 

 Shall we go down to the kitchen? Hermione suggested after a little pause. Find 
something for breakfast? 

 He agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto the landing and past the 
second door that led off it. There were deep scratch marks in the paintwork below a small 
sign that he had not noticed in the dark. He passed at the top of the stairs to read it. It was 
a pompous little sign, neatly lettered by hand the sort of thing that Percy Weasley might 
have stuck on his bedroom door. 

 

Do Not Enter 


Without the Express Permission of 

Regulus Arcturus Black 

 

Excitement trickled through Harry, but he was not immediately sure why. He read the 
sign again. Hermione was already a flight of stairs below him. 

 Hermione, he said, and he was surprised that his voice was so calm. Come 
back up here. 

 Whats the matter? 

 R.A.B. I think Ive found him. 

 There was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up the stairs. 

 In your mums letter? But I didnt see C 

 Harry shook his head, pointing at Reguluss sign. She read it, then clutched 
Harrys arm so tightly that he winced. 

 Siriuss brother? she whispered. 

 He was a Death Eater, said Harry. Sirius told me about him, he joined up when 
he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave C so they killed him. 

 That fits! gasped Hermione. If he was a Death Eater he had access to 
Voldemort, and if he became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring 
Voldemort down! 

 She released Harry, leaned over the banister, and screamed, Ron! RON! Get up 
here, quick! 

 Ron appeared, panting, a minute later, his wand ready in his hand. 

 Whats up? If its massive spiders again I want breakfast before I C 

 He frowned at the sign on Reguluss door, in which Hermione was silently 
pointing. 

 What? That was Siriuss brother, wasnt it? Regulus Arcturus  Regulus  
R.A.B.! The locket C you dont reckon -- ? 

 Lets find out, said Harry. He pushed the door: It was locked. Hermione pointed 
her wand at the handle and said, Alohamora. There was a click, and the door swung 
open. 

 They moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Reguluss bedroom was 
slightly smaller than Siriuss, though it had the same sense of former grandeur. Whereas 
Sirius had sought to advertise his diffidence from the rest of the family, Regulus had 
striven to emphasize the opposite. The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were 
everywhere, draping the bed, the walls, and the windows. The Black family crest was 
painstakingly painted over the bed, along with its motto, TOUJOURS PUR. Beneath this 
was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck together to make a ragged 
collage. Hermione crossed the room to examine them. 

 Theyre all about Voldemort, she said. Regulus seems to have been a fan for a 
few years before he joined the Death Eaters  

 A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings. 
Harry, meanwhile, had noticed another photograph: a Hogwarts Quidditch team was 
smiling and waving out of the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned 
on their chests: Slytherins. Regulus was instantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the 
middle of the front row: He had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his 
brother, though he was smaller, slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been. 


 He played Seeker, said Harry. 

What? said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Voldemorts press 
clippings. 

 Hes sitting in the middle of the front row, thats where the Seeker  Never 
mind, said Harry, realizing that nobody was listening. Ron was on his hands and knees, 
searching under the wardrobe. Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and 
approached the desk. Yet again, somebody had searched before them. The drawers 
contents had been turned over recently, the dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value 
there: old quills, out-of-date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled, a 
recently smashed ink bottle, its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer. 

 Theres an easier way, said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky fingers on his 
jeans. She raised her wand and said, Accio Locket! 

 Nothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains, 
looked disappointed. 

 Is that it, then? Its not here? 

 Oh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments, said Hermione. 
Charms to prevent it from being summoned magically, you know. 

 Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave, said Harry, remembering 
how he had been unable to Summon the fake locket. 

 How are we supposed to find it then? asked Ron. 

 We search manually, said Hermione. 

 Thats a good idea, said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed his examination 
of the curtains. 

 They combed every inch of the room for more than an hour, but were forced, 
finally, to conclude that the locket was not there. 

 The sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing 
windows. 

 It could be somewhere else in the house, though, said Hermione in a rallying 
tone as they walked back downstairs. As Harry and Ron had become more discouraged, 
she seemed to have become more determined. Whether hed manage to destroy it or not, 
hed want to keep it hidden from Voldemort, wouldnt he? Remember all those awful 
things we had to get rid of when we were here last time? That clock that shot bolts at 
everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle Ron; Regulus might have put them 
there to protect the lockets hiding place, even though we didnt realize it at  at   

 Harry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with one foot in midair, with the 
dumbstruck look of one who had just been Obliviated: her eyes had even drifted out of 
focus. 

  at the time, she finished in a whisper. 

 Something wrong? asked Ron. 

 There was a locket. 

 What? said Harry and Ron together. 

 In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And we  we   

 Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach. He 
remembered. He had even handled the thing as they passed it around, each trying in turn 
to pry it open. It had been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of 
Wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy  


 Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us, said Harry. It was the only 
chance, the only slender hope left to them, and he was going to cling to it until forced to 
let go. He had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. Cmon. 

 He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two thundering along 
in his wake. They made so much noise that they woke the portrait of Siriuss mother as 
they passed through the hall. 

 Filth! Mudbloods! Scum! she screamed after them as they dashed down into the 
basement kitchen and slammed the door behind them. Harry ran the length of the room, 
skidded to a halt at the door of Kreachers cupboard, and wrenched it open. There was the 
nest of dirty old blankets in which the house-elf had once slept, but they were not longer 
glittering with the trinkets Kreacher had salvaged. The only thing there was an old copy 
of Natures Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. Refusing to believe his eyes, Harry 
snatched up the blankets and shook them. A dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally 
across the floor. Ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair; Hermione closed 
her eyes. 

 Its not over yet, said Harry, and he raised his voice and called, Kreacher! 

 There was a loud crack and the house elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited 
from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace: tiny, half 
human-sized, his pale skin hanging off him in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from 
his batlike ears. He was still wearing the filthy rag in which they had first met him, and 
the contemptuous look he bent upon Harry showed that his attitude to his change of 
ownership had altered no more than his outfit. 

 Master, croaked Kreacher in his bullfrogs voice, and he bowed low; muttering 
to his knees, back in my Mistresss old house with the blood-traitor Weasley and the 
Mudblood C 

 I forbid you to call anyone blood traitor or Mudblood, growled Harry. He 
would have found Kreacher, with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctively 
unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort. 

 Ive got a question for you, said Harry, his heart beating rather fast as he looked 
down at the elf, and I order you to answer it truthfully. Understand? 

 Yes, Master, said Kreacher, bowing low again. Harry saw his lips moving 
soundlessly, undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter. 

 Two years ago, said Harry, his heart now hammering against his ribs, there 
was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. Did you steal it 
back? 

 There was a moments silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look 
Harry full in the face. Then he said, Yes. 

 Where is it now? asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful. 

 Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to his 
next word. 

 Gone. 

 Gone? echoed Harry, elation floating out of him, What do you mean, its 
gone? 

 The elf shivered. He swayed. 

 Kreacher, said Harry fiercely, I order you C 


 Mundungus Fletcher, croaked the elf, his eyes still tight shut. Mundungus 
Fletcher stole it all; Miss Bellas and Miss Cissys pictures, my Mistresss gloves, the 
Order of Merlin, First Class, the goblets with the family crest, and C and C  

 Kreacher was gulping for air: His hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly, then 
his eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream. 

 and the locket, Master Reguluss locket. Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed 
in his orders! 

 Harry reacted instinctively: As Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate, 
he launched himself upon the elf, flattening him. Hermiones scream mingled with 
Kreachers but Harry bellowed louder than both of them: Kreacher, I order you to stay 
still! 

 He felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor, 
tears gushing from his sagging eyes. 

 Harry, let him up! Hermione whispered. 

 So he can beat himself up with the poker? snorted Harry, kneeling beside the elf. 
I dont think so. Right. Kreacher, I want the truth: How do you know Mundungus 
Fletcher stole the locket? 

 Kreacher saw him! gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his 
mouth full of graying teeth. Kreacher saw him coming out of Kreachers cupboard with 
his hands full of Kreachers treasures. Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop, but 
Mundungus Fletcher laughed and r-ran   

 You called the locket Master Reguluss, said Harry. Why? Where did it 
come from? What did Regulus have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything 
you know about that locket, and everything Regulus had to do with it! 

 The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between his knees, and began 
to rock backward and forward. When he spoke, his voice was muffled but quite distinct 
in the silent, echoing kitchen. 

 Master Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a bad boy and broke my 
Mistresss heart with his lawless ways. But Master Regulus had proper order; he knew 
what was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked 
of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles 
and the Muggle-borns  and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the 
Dark Lord. So proud, so proud, so happy to serve  

 And one day, a year after he joined, Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to 
see Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said  he 
said  

 The old elf rocked faster than ever. 

  he said that the Dark Lord required an elf. 

 Voldemort needed an elf? Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and Hermione, 
who looked just as puzzled as he did. 

 Oh yes, moaned Kreacher. And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. It 
was an honor, said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure 
to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do  and then to c-come home. 

 Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs. 


 So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what 
they were to do, but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the 
cave was a cavern, and in the cavern was a great black lake   

 The hairs on the back of Harrys neck stood up. Kreachers croaking voice 
seemed to come to him from across the dark water. He saw what had happened as clearly 
as though he had been present. 

  There was a boat  

 Of course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and tiny, 
bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center. This, 
then, was how Voldemort had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux, by borrowing 
a disposable creature, a house-elf 

 There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D-Dark Lord made 
Kreacher drink it  

 The elf quaked from head to foot. 

 Kreacher drank, and as he drank he saw terrible thing  Kreachers insides 
burned  Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, 
but the Dark Lord only laughed  He made Kreacher drink all the potion  He dropped 
a locket into the empty basin  He filled it with more potion. 

 And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island   

 Harry could see it happening. He watched Voldemorts white, snakelike face 
vanishing into darkness, those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death 
would occur within minutes, whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the 
burning poison caused its victim  But here, Harrys imagination could go no further, 
for he could not see how Kreacher had escaped. 

 Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the islands edge and he drank from the 
black lake  and hands, dead hands, came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under 
the surface   

 How did you get away? Harry asked, and he was not surprised to hear himself 
whispering. 

 Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked Harry with his great, bloodshot eyes. 

 Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back, he said. 

 I know C but how did you escape the Inferi? 

 Kreacher did not seem to understand. 

 Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back, he repeated. 

 I know, but C  

 Well, its obvious, isnt it, Harry? said Ron. He Disapparated! 

 But  you couldnt Apparate in and out of that cave, said Harry, otherwise 
Dumbledore C  

 Elf magic isnt like wizards magic, is it? said Ron, I mean, they can Apparate 
and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we cant. 

 There was a silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort have made such 
a mistake? But even as he thought this, Hermione spoke, and her voice was icy. 

 Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves far 
beneath his notice  It would never have occurred to him that they might have magic 
that he didnt. 


 The house-elfs highest law is his Masters bidding, intoned Kreacher. 
Kreacher was told to come home, so Kreacher came home   

 Well, then, you did what you were told, didnt you? said Hermione kindly. 
You didnt disobey orders at all! 

 Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever. 

 So what happened when you got back? Harry asked. What did Regulus say 
when you told him what happened? 

 Master Regulus was very worried, very worried, croaked Kreacher. Master 
Regulus told Kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house. And then  it was a 
little while later  Master Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and 
Master Regulus was strange, not as he usually was, disturbed in his mind, Kreacher could 
tell  and he asked Kreacher to take him to the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone 
with the Dark Lord   

 And so they had set off. Harry could visualize them quite clearly, the frightened 
old elf and the thin, dark Seeker who had so resembled Sirius  Kreacher knew how to 
open the concealed entrance to the underground cavern, knew how to raise the tiny boat: 
this time it was his beloved Regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of 
poison  

 And he made you drink the poison? said Harry, disgusted. 

 But Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermiones hands leapt to her mouth: She 
seemed to have understood something. 

 M-Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord 
had, said Kreacher, tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose. And he told 
Kreacher to take it and, when the basin was empty, to switch the lockets  

 Kreachers sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concentrate hard to 
understand him. 

 And he order C Kreacher to leave C without him. And he told Kreacher C to go 
home C and never to tell my Mistress C what he had done C but to destroy C the first 
locket. And he drank C all the potion C and Kreacher swapped the lockets C and watched 
 as Master Regulus  was dragged beneath the water  and   

 Oh, Kreacher! wailed Hermione, who was crying. She dropped to her knees 
beside the elf and tried to hug him. At once he was on his feet, cringing away from her, 
quite obviously repulsed. 

 The Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, what would his Mistress 
say? 

 I told you not to call her Mudblood! snarled Harry, but the elf was already 
punishing himself. He fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor. 

 Stop him C stop him! Hermione cried. Oh, dont you see now how sick it is, 
the way theyve got to obey? 

 Kreacher C stop, stop! shouted Harry. 

 The elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus glistening around his 
snot, a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself, his 
eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears. Harry had never seen anything so 
pitiful. 

 So you brought the locket home, he said relentlessly, for he was determined to 
know the full story. And you tried to destroy it? 


 Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it, moaned the elf. Kreacher tried 
everything, everything he knew, but nothing, nothing would work  So many powerful 
spells upon the casing, Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it 
would not open  Kreacher punished himself, he tried again, he punished himself, he 
tried again. Kreacher failed to obey orders, Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And 
his mistress was mad with grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared and Kreacher 
could not tell her what had happened, no, because Master Regulus had f-f-forbidden him 
to tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave  

 Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. Tears 
flowed down Hermiones cheeks as she watched Kreacher, but she did not dare touch 
him again. Even Ron, who was no fan of Kreachers, looked troubled. Harry sat back on 
his heels and shook his head, trying to clear it. 

 I dont understand you, Kreacher, he said finally. Voldemort tried to kill you, 
Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to 
Voldemort? You were happy to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to 
Voldemort through them   

 Harry, Kreacher doesnt think like that, said Hermione, wiping her eyes on the 
back of her hand. Hes a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what 
Voldemort did to Kreacher wasnt that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars 
mean to an elf like Kreacher? Hes loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black 
must have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted 
their beliefs. I know what youre going to say, she went on as Harry began to protest, 
that Regulus changed his mind  but he doesnt seem to have explained that to 
Kreacher, does he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and Reguluss family were all 
safest if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to protect them all. 

 Sirius C  

 Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and its no good looking like that, you 
know its true. Kreacher had been alone for such a long time when Sirius came to live 
here, and he was probably starving for a bit of affection. Im sure Miss Cissy and Miss 
Bella were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favor and 
told them everything they wanted to know. Ive said all along that wizards would pay for 
how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort did  and so did Sirius. 

 Harry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, he 
remembered what Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours after Siriuss death: I do not 
think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a humans  

 Kreacher, said Harry after a while, when you feel up to it, er  please sit up. 

 It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccupped himself into silence. Then he 
pushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a 
small child. 

 Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something, said Harry. He glanced at 
Hermione for assistance. He wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, he 
could not pretend that it was not an order. However, the change in his tone seemed to 
have gained her approval: She smiled encouragingly. 

 Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus Fletcher. We need to 
find out where the locket C where Master Reguluss locket it. Its really important. We 


want to finish the work Master Regulus started, we want to C er C ensure that he didnt 
die in vain. 

 Kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry. 

 Find Mundungus Fletcher? he croaked. 

 And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place, said Harry. Do you think you could 
do that for us? 

 As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden inspiration. He pulled 
out Hagrids purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus 
had placed the note to Voldemort. 

 Kreacher, Id, er, like you to have this, he said, pressing the locket into the elfs 
hand. This belonged to Regulus and Im sure hed want you to have it as a token of 
gratitude for what you 

 Overkill, mate, said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a howl of 
shock and misery, and threw himself back onto the ground. 

 It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so overcome to 
be presented with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the 
knees to stand properly. When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all 
accompanied him to his cupboard, watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty 
blankets, and assured him that they would make its protection their first priority while he 
was away. He then made two low bows to Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little 
spasm in Hermiones direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute, 
before Disapparating with the usual loud crack. 

 

Chapter Eleven 

The Bribe 

 

If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident that the capture 
of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and he prowled the house all morning in a 
state of high anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that 
afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed 
largely of moldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful 
Transfigurations, did nothing to help. 

Kreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two 
cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve, and they remained there 
into the night, gazing in the direction of the house that they could not see. 

Death Eaters, for sure, said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione watched from the 
drawing room windows. Reckon they know were in here? 

I dont think so, said Hermione, though she looked frightened, or theyd have 
sent Snape in after us, wouldnt they? 

Dyou reckon hes been in here and has his tongue tied by Moodys curse? 
asked Ron. 

Yes, said Hermione, otherwise hed have been able to tell that lot how to get in, 
wouldnt he? But theyre probably watching to see whether we turn up. They know that 
Harry owns the house, after all. 


How do they --? began Harry. 

Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? Theyll know Sirius 
left you the place. 

The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside 
number twelve. They had not heard a word form anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since 
Mr. Weasleys Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had 
developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket; This 
particularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by 
studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept 
flashing on and off. 

Will you stop it! she cried on the third evening of Kreachers absence, as all the 
light was sucked from the drawing room yet again. 

Sorry, sorry! said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. I 
dont know Im doing it! 

Well, cant you find something useful to occupy yourself? 

What, like reading kids stories? 

Dumbledore left me this book, Ron C 

and he left me the Deluminator, maybe Im supposed to use it! 

Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either 
of them. He headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was 
sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of 
stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the 
grinding of the chain. 

Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his wand, moved into the 
shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened: He saw a 
glimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed 
the door behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and Moodys voice asked, Severus 
Snape? Then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its 
dead hand. 

It was not I who killed you, Albus, said a quiet voice. 

The jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it was impossible to make 
out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind. 

Harry pointed the wand into the middle of it. 

Dont move! 

He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his yell, the curtains 
hiding her flew open and she began to scream, Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my 
house C 

Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, 
like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below. 

Hold your fire, its me, Remus! 

Oh, thank goodness, said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. Black 
instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his 
wand, but Harry did not. 

Show yourself! he called back. 

Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of 
surrender. 


I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four 
creators of the Marauders Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I 
taught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag. 

Oh, all right, said Harry, lowering his wand, but I had to check, didnt I? 

Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that 
you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldnt be so quick to lower your defenses. 

They ran down the stairs towards him. Wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak, 
he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them. 

No sign of Severus, then? he asked. 

No, said Harry. Whats going on? Is everyone okay? 

Yes, said Lupin, but were all being watched. There are a couple of Death 
Eaters in the square outside C 

We know C 

I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be 
sure that they would not see me. They cant know youre in here or Im sure theyd have 
more people out there; theyre staking out everywhere thats got any connection with you, 
Harry. Lets go downstairs, theres a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened 
after you left the Burrow. 

They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at the grate. 
A fire sprang up instantly: It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and 
glistened off the long wooden table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his 
traveling cloak and they sat down. 

Id have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater 
tailing me, said Lupin. So, you came straight here after the wedding? 

No, said Harry, only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a caf on 
Tottenham Court Road. 

Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front. 

What? 

They explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast. 

But how did they find you so quickly? Its impossible to track anyone who 
Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear. 

And it doesnt seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road 
at the time, does it? said Harry. 

We wondered, said Hermione tentatively, whether Harry could still have the 
Trace on him? 

Impossible, said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. 
Apart from anything else, theyd know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace 
on him, wouldnt they? But I cant see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham 
Court Road, thats worrying, really worrying. 

He looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait. 

Tell us what happened after we left, we havent heard a thing since Rons dad 
told us the family was safe. 

Well, Kingsley saved us, said Lupin. Thanks to his warning most of the 
wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived. 

Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people? interjected Hermione. 


A mixture; but to all intents and purposes theyre the same thing now, said 
Lupin. There were about a dozen of them, but they didnt know you were there, Harry. 
Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before 
they killed him; if its true, he didnt give you away. 

Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock 
and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was 
true, the mans final act had been to try to protect Harry. 

The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom, Lupin went on. 
They found the ghoul, but didnt want to get too close C and then they interrogated those 
of us who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of 
course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there. 

At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters 
were forcing their way into every Order-connected house in the country. No deaths, he 
added quickly, forestalling the question, but they were rough. They burned down 
Dedalus Diggles house, but as you know he wasnt there, and they used the Cruciarus 
Curse on Tonkss family. Again, trying to find out where you went after you visited them. 
Theyre all right C shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay. 

The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms? 

Harry asked, remembering how effective these had been on the night he had 
crashed in Tonkss parents garden. 

What youve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full 
might of the Ministry on their side now, said Lupin. Theyve got the power to perform 
brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every 
defensive spell wed cast against them, and once inside, they were completely open about 
why theyd come. 

And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harrys whereabouts out 
of people? asked Hermione, an edge to her voice. 

Well, Lupin said. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily 
Prophet. 

Here, he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, youll know sooner or later 
anyway. Thats their pretext for going after you. 

Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face filled the front 
page. He read the headline over it: 

 

 WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT 

 THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 

 

Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. He pushed the 
newspaper away; he did not want to read anymore: He knew what it would say. Nobody 
but those who had been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really 
killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world, Harry had been 
seen running from the place moments after Dumbledore had fallen. 

Im sorry, Harry, Lupin said. 

So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too? asked Hermione 
furiously. 

Lupin nodded. 


But surely people realize whats going on? 

The coup has been smooth and virtually silent, said Lupin. 

The official version of Scrimgeours murder is that he resigned; he has been 
replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse. 

Why didnt Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic? asked Ron. 

Lupin laughed. 

He doesnt need to, Ron. Effectively, he is the Minister, but why should he sit 
behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday 
business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry. 

Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a 
dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that 
Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. They darent 
confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case 
their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very 
clever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked 
has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear. 

And this dramatic change in Ministry policy, said Harry, involves warning the 
Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort? 

Thats certainly a part of it, said Lupin, and it is a masterstroke. Now that 
Dumbledore is dead, you C the Boy Who Lived C were sure to be the symbol and rallying 
point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old 
hats death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear 
amongst many who would have defended you. 

Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggle-borns. 

Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet. 

Look at page two. 

Hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had 
when handling Secrets of the Darkest Art. 

Muggle-born Register! she read aloud. The Ministry of Magic is undertaking 
a survey of so-called Muggle-borns the better to understand how they came to possess 
magical secrets. 

Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic 
can only be passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no proven 
Wizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the so-called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained 
magical power by theft or force. 

The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to 
this end has issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for 
interview by the newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission. 

People wont let this happen, said Ron. 

It is happening, Ron, said Lupin. Muggle-borns are being rounded up as we 
speak. 

But how are they supposed to have stolen magic? said Ron. Its mental, if 
you could steal magic there wouldnt be any Squibs, would there? 

I know, said Lupin. Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least 
one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power 
illegally and must suffer the punishment. 


Ron glanced at Hermione, then said, What if purebloods and halfbloods swear a 
Muggle-borns part of their family? Ill tell everyone Hermiones my cousin C 

Hermione covered Rons hand with hers and squeezed it. 

Thank you, Ron, but I couldnt let you C 

You wont have a choice, said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back. Ill teach 
you my family tree so you can answer questions on it. 

Hermione gave a shaky laugh. 

Ron, as were on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the 
country, I dont think it matters. If I was going back to school it would be different. 
Whats Voldemort planning for Hogwarts? she asked Lupin. 

Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard, he replied. 
That was announced yesterday. Its a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of 
course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their 
parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This 
way, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young 
age. And its also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be 
given Blood Status C meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that they are of 
Wizard descent C before they are allowed to attend. 

Harry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds would be 
poring over stacks of newly purchased spell-books, unaware that they would never see 
Hogwarts, perhaps never see their families again either. 

Its . . . its . . . he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the 
horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly, 

I know. 

Lupin hesitated. 

Ill understand if you cant confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the 
impression that Dumbledore left you a mission. 

He did, Harry replied, and Ron and Hermione are in on it and theyre coming 
with me. 

Can you confide in me what the mission is? 

Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, 
and wished that he could return a different answer. 

I cant, Remus, Im sorry. If Dumbledore didnt tell you I dont think I can. 

I thought youd say that, said Lupin, looking disappointed. But I might still be 
of some use to you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to 
provide protection. There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to. 

Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to 
keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not 
imagine. 

Hermione, however, looked puzzled. 

But what about Tonks? she asked. 

What about her? said Lupin. 

Well, said Hermione, frowning, youre married! How does she feel about you 
going away with us? 

Tonks will be perfectly safe, said Lupin, Shell be at her parents house. 


There was something strange in Lupins tone, it was almost cold. There was also 
something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents house; she was, after 
all, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick 
of the action. 

Remus, said Hermione tentatively, is everything all right . . . you know . . . 
between you and C  

Everything is fine, thank you, said Lupin pointedly. 

Hermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and embarrassed 
one, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant, 
Tonks is going to have a baby. 

Oh, how wonderful! squealed Hermione. 

Excellent! said Ron enthusiastically. 

Congratulations, said Harry. 

Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said, So . . . do 
you accept my offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that Dumbledore would 
have disapproved, he appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. 
And I must tell you that I believe we are facing magic many of us have never 
encountered or imagined. 

Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry. 

Just C just to be clear, he said. You want to leave Tonks at her parents house 
and come away with us? 

Shell be perfectly safe there, theyll look after her, said Lupin. He spoke with a 
finality bordering on indifference: Harry, Im sure James would have wanted me to stick 
with you. 

Well, said Harry slowly, Im not. Im pretty sure my father would have wanted 
to know why you arent sticking with your own kid, actually. 

Lupins face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen might have dropped 
ten degrees. Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, 
while Hermiones eyes swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin. 

You dont understand, said Lupin at last. 

Explain, then, said Harry. 

Lupin swallowed. 

I C I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better 
judgment and have regretted it very much every since. 

I see, said Harry, so youre just going to dump her and the kid and run off with 
us? 

Lupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled over backward, and he glared at them 
so fiercely that Harry saw, for the first time ever, she shadow of the wolf upon his human 
face. 

Dont you understand what Ive done to my wife and my unborn child? I should 
never have married her, Ive made her an outcast! 

Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned. 

You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledores 
protection at Hogwarts! You dont know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures 
like me! When they know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Dont you see 
what Ive done? 


Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, what parents want their only 
daughter to marry a werewolf? And the child C the child C  

Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged. 

My kind dont usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it C how can I 
forgive myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent 
child? And if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times 
so, without a father of whom it must always be ashamed! 

Remus! whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. Dont say that C how could 
any child be ashamed of you? 

Oh, I dont know, Hermione, said Harry. Id be pretty ashamed of him. 

Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to 
his feet too. Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him. 

If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad, Harry said, what will they do 
to a half-werewolf whose fathers in the Order? My father died trying to protect my 
mother and me, and you reckon hed tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure 
with us? 

How C how dare you? said Lupin. This is not about a desire for C for danger or 
personal glory C how dare you suggest such a C  

I think youre feeling a bit of a daredevil, Harry said, You fancy stepping into 
Siriuss shoes C 

Harry, no! Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupins livid 
face. 

Id never have believed this, Harry said. The man who taught me to fight 
dementors C a coward. 

Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was 
a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the 
kitchen wall and slid to the floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupins cloak disappearing 
around the door. 

Remus, Remus, come back! Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A 
moment later they heard the front door slam. 

Harry! wailed Hermione. How could you? 

It was easy, said Harry. He stood up, he could feel a lump swelling where his 
head had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking. 

Dont look at me like that! he snapped at Hermione. 

Dont you start on her! snarled Ron. 

No C no C we mustnt fight! said Hermione, launching herself between them. 

You shouldnt have said that stuff to Lupin, Ron told Harry. 

He had it coming to him, said Harry. Broken images were racing each other 
through his mind: Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in 
midair; a flash of green light and his mothers voice, begging for mercy . . . 

Parents, said Harry, shouldnt leave their kids unless C unless theyve got to. 

Harry C said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off 
and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to 
Lupin out of that fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled 
him. Now Lupins tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a 


sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that 
they were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently. 

He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away form each other. 

I know I shouldnt have called him a coward. 

No, you shouldnt, said Ron at once. 

But hes acting like one. 

All the same . . . said Hermione. 

I know, said Harry. But if it makes him go back to Tonks, itll be worth it, 
wont it? 

He could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron 
uncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James have 
backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son 
had treated his old friend? 

The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron 
and Hermiones unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still 
lying on the table, Harrys own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He 
walked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He 
could not take in the words; his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He 
was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other 
side of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledores name leapt out at him. It 
was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a 
family group. Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to 
right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra, and Aberforth. 

His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledores 
father, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this 
faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no 
more distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet black hair pulled into a high bun. 
Her face had a carved quality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native Americans hed 
seen as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed 
above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets 
and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but 
otherwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albuss nose had been 
broken and before he started wearing glasses. 

The family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the 
newspaper. Baby Arianas arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above the 
picture and saw the headline: 

 

 EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM UPCOMING 

 BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 

 by Rita Skeeter 

 

Thinking it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry 
began to read: 

 


Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-
Wold after her husband Percivals well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in 
Azkaban. She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godrics Hollow, 
the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potters strange escape 
from You-Know-Who. 

 Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godrics Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding 
families, but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about 
her husbands crime she had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the 
friendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family 
was left well alone. 

 Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch 
of homemade Cauldron Cakes, says Bathilda Bagshot. The first year they were 
there I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldnt have known there was a daughter if I 
hadnt been picking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and 
saw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, 
keeping a firm grip on her, then took her back inside. Didnt know what to make of 
it. 

 It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godrics Hollow was the perfect 
opportunity to hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been 
planning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old 
when she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that 
magic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever 
demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It seems clear, therefore, that 
Kendra made a decision to hide her daughters existence rather than suffer the shame 
of admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and 
neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. 
The tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Arianas existence could be 
counted upon to keep the secret, including her two brothers, who had deflected 
awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them. My sister is too 
frail for school. 

 Next week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts C the Prizes and the Pretense. 

 

 Harry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him feel worse. He 
looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he 
find out? He wanted to go to Godrics Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk 
to him: he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. 
He was in the process of lowering the newspaper, to ask Rons and Hermiones opinions, 
when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen. 

 For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His 
immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he 
did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside 
his chair. He hurried to his feet as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to 
Harry, croaked, Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master. 

 Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too 
quick for him. 

 Expelliarmus! 


 Mundunguss wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, 
Mundungus dived for the stairs. Ron rugby-tackled him and Mundungus hit the stone 
floor with a muffled crunch. 

 What? he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Rons grip. 
Whave I done? Setting a bleedin house-elf on me, what are you playing at, whave I 
done, lemme go, lemme go, of C  

 Youre not in much of a position to make threats, said Harry. He threw aside 
the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his knees beside 
Mundungus, who stopped struggling and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and 
watched as Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mundunguss nose. Mundungus stank 
of stale sweat and tobacco smoke. His hair was matted and his robes stained. 

 Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master, croaked the elf. 
Fletcher knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and accomplices. 
Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end. 

 Youve done really well, Kreacher, said Harry, and the elf bowed low. 

 Right, weve got a few questions for you, Harry told Mundungus, who shouted 
at once. 

 I panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense, mate, but I never 
volunteered to die for you, an that was bleedin You-Know-Who come flying at me, 
anyone woulda got outta there. I said all along I didnt wanna do it C 

 For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated, said Hermione. 

 Well, youre a bunch of bleedin eroes then, arent you, but I never pretended I 
was up for killing meself C 

 Were not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye, said Harry, moving his 
wand a little closer to Mundunguss baggy, bloodshot eyes. We already knew you were 
an unreliable bit of scum. 

 Well then, why the ell am I being unted down by ouse-elves? Or is this about 
them goblets again? I aint got none of em left, or you could ave em C 

 Its not about the goblets either, although youre getting warmer, said Harry. 
Shut up and listen. 

 It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he could demand 
some small portion of truth. Harrys wand was now so close to the bridge of 
Mundunguss nose that Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view. 

 When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable, Harry began, but 
Mundungus interrupted him again. 

 Sirius never cared about any of the junk C 

 There was the sound of pattering fee, a blaze of shining copper, an echoing clang, 
and a shriek of agony; Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the head 
with a saucepan. 

 Call im off, call im off, e should be locked up! screamed Mundungus, 
cowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan again. 

 Kreacher, no! shouted Harry. 

 Kreachers thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft. 

 Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck? 

 Ron laughed. 


 We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading, you can do the 
honors, said Harry. 

 Thank you very much, Master, said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a 
short distance, his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing. 

 When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find, Harry began 
again, you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there. 
Harrys mouth was suddenly dry: He could sense Ron and Hermiones tension and 
excitement too. What did you do with it? 

 Why? asked Mundungus. Is it valuable? 

 Youve still got it! cried Hermione. 

 No, he hasnt, said Ron shrewdly. Hes wondering whether he should have 
asked more money for it. 

 More? said Mundungus. That wouldnt have been effing difficult . . .bleedin 
gave it away, din I? No choice. 

 What do you mean? 

 I was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if Ive got a 
license for trading in magical artifacts. Bleedin snoop. She was gonna fine me, but she 
took a fancy to the locket an told me shed take it and let me off that time, and to fink 
meself lucky. 

 Who was this woman? asked Harry. 

 I dunno, some Ministry hag. 

 Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled. 

 Little woman. Bow on top of er head. 

 He frowned and then added, Looked like a toad. 

 Harry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into 
his eyebrows, which ignited. 

 Aquamenti! screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, 
engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus. 

 Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Rons and Hermiones faces. 
The scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again. 

 

Chapter Twelve 

Magic is Might 

 

 As August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the middle of Grimmauld 
Place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number 
twelve were never seen by anyone in the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve 
itself. The muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing 
mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen. 

 And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the 
anomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in 
Grimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings 
facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The 
lurkers were never the same two days running, although they all seemed to share a dislike 


for normal clothing. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric 
dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back, 
wondering why anyone would wear cloaks in this heat. 

 The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. 
Occasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something 
interesting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed. 

 On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than 
ever before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at 
houses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared 
elusive. As evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first 
time in weeks, there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to 
have seen something interesting. The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest 
companion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a moment later they had relaxed 
into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and disappointed. 

 Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the hall. He had nearly 
lost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought 
that the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. 
Shutting the front door carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped 
it over his arm, and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the 
basement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand. 

 The usual low whisper of Severus Snape greeted him, the chill wind swept him, 
and his tongue rolled up for a moment. 

 I didnt kill you, he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as the dusty 
jinx-figure exploded. He waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen, out 
of earshot of Mrs. Black and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, Ive got news, and 
you wont like it. 

 The kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now shone; Copper pots 
and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets 
and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which 
a cauldron was simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more dramatically 
different than the house-elf who now came hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-
white towel, his ear hair as clean and fluffy as cotton wool, Reguluss locket bouncing on 
his thin chest. 

 Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner, 
croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on 
the wall, beside a number of old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered. 

 Whats happened? Ron asked apprehensively. He are Hermione had been 
pouring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand drawn maps that littered the end of the 
long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down 
the newspaper on top of their scattered parchment. 

 A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, 
beneath a headline that read: 

 

 SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER 

 

 No! said Ron and Hermione loudly. 


 Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the 
accompanying story out loud. 

 Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft 
and wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing 
changes at the ancient school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies 
teacher, Alecto Carrow will take over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the 
position of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. 

  I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values 
C Like committing murder and cutting off peoples ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! 
Snape in Dumbledores study C Merlins pants! she shrieked, making both Harry and 
Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, 
Ill be back in a minute! 

 Merlins pants? repeated Ron, looking amused. She must be upset. He 
pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape. 

 The other teachers wont stand for this, McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all 
know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They wont accept Snape as 
headmaster. And who are these Carrows? 

 Death Eaters, said Harry. There are pictures of them inside. They were at the 
top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so its all friends together. And, Harry 
went on bitterly, drawing up a chair, I cant see that the other teachers have got any 
choice but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape itll be a choice 
between staying and teaching, or a nice few years in Azkaban C and thats if theyre 
lucky. I reckon theyll stay to try and protect the students. 

 Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large curcen in his hands, and ladled 
out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so. 

 Thanks, Kreacher, said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to 
look at Snapes face. Well, at least we know exactly where Snape is now. 

 He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreachers cooking had 
improved dramatically ever since he had been given Reguluss locket: Todays French 
onion was as good as Harry had ever tasted. 

 There are still a load of Death Eaters watching this house, he told Ron as he ate, 
more than usual. Its like theyre hoping well march out carrying our school trunks and 
head off for the Hogwarts Express. 

 Ron glanced at his watch. 

 Ive been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not 
being on it, isnt it? 

 In his minds eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had 
once followed it by air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. 
He was sure Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps 
wondering where he, Ron, and Hermione were, or debating how best to undermine 
Snapes new regime. 

 They nearly saw me coming back in just now, Harry said, I landed badly on 
the top step, and the Cloak slipped. 

 I do that every time. Oh, here she is, Ron added, craning around in his seat to 
watch Hermione reentering the kitchen. And what in the name of Merlins most baggy 
Y Fronts was that about? 


 I remembered this, Hermione panted. 

 She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered to the floor 
before seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. Opening it, she 
proceeded to force the painting inside and despite the fact that it was patently too large to 
fit inside the tiny bag, within a few seconds it had vanished, like so much ease, into the 
bags capacious depths. 

 Phineas Nigellus, Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen 
table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash. 

 Sorry? said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of Phineas Nigellus 
Black was able to travel between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in 
the headmasters office at Hogwarts: the circular cower-top room where Snape was no 
doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledores collection of delicate, 
silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it ad been 
moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor. 

 Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him, Hermione 
explained to Ron as she resumed her seat. But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus 
will be able to see is the inside of my handbag. 

 Good thinking! said Ron, looking impressed. 

 Thank you, smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her. So, Harry, what 
else happened today? 

 Nothing, said Harry. Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours. No sign 
of her. Saw your dad though, Ron. He looks fine. 

 Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. The had agreed that it was far too 
dangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the 
Ministry, because he was always surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, 
reassuring to catch these glimpses of him, even if he did look very strained and anxious. 

 Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work, 
Ron said. Thats why we havent seen Umbridge, shed never walk, shed think shes 
too important. 

 And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes? 
Hermione asked. 

 Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance, said Ron. 

 How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance? Hermione asked, her 
soupspoon suspended in midair. 

 Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes. 

 But you never told us that! 

 Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps 
that she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen. 

 Theres nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing! she said, flipping 
feverishly through the pages. 

 Well, dies it really matter? 

 Ron, it all matters! If were going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves 
away when theyre bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters! 
Weve been over and over this, I mean, whats the point of all these reconnaissance trips 
if you arent even bothering to tell us C 

 Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing C  


 You do realize, dont you, that theres probably no more dangerous place in the 
whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of C 

 I think we should do it tomorrow, said Harry. 

 Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his soup. 

 Tomorrow? repeated Hermione. You arent serious, Harry? 

 I am, said Harry. I dont think were going to be much better prepared than we 
are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we 
put it off, the farther away that locket could be. Theres already a good chance Umbridge 
has chucked it away; the thing doesnt open. 

 Unless, said Ron, shes found a way of opening it and shes now possessed. 

 Wouldnt make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first place, Harry 
shrugged. 

 Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought. 

 We know everything important, Harry went on, addressing Hermione. We 
know theyve stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry; We know only the most 
senior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now, 
because Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly 
where Umbridges office is, because of what you heard the bearded bloke saying to his 
mate C 

 Ill be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me, Hermione recited 
immediately. 

 Exactly, said Harry. And we know you get in using those funny coins, or 
tokens, or whatever they are, because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend C  

 But we havent got any! 

 If the plan works, we will have, Harry continued calmly. 

 I dont know, Harry, I dont know  There are an awful lot of things that could 
go wrong, so much relies on chance   

 Thatll be true even if we spend another three months preparing, said Harry. Its 
time to act. 

 He could tell from Rons and Hermiones faces that they were scared; he was not 
particularly confident himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan 
into operation. 

 They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisibility 
Cloak and spy on the official entrance to the Ministry, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, 
had known since childhood. They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, 
eavesdropped on their conversations, and learned by careful observation which of them 
could be relied upon to appear, alone, at the same time every day. Occasionally there had 
been a chance to sneak a Daily Prophet out of somebodys briefcase. Slowly they had 
built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of Hermione. 

 All right, said Ron slowly, lets say we go for it tomorrow  I think it should 
just be me and Harry. 

 Oh, dont start that again! sighed Hermione. I thought wed settled this. 

 Its one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different. 
Hermione, Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously. 
Youre on the list of Muggle-borns who didnt present themselves for interrogation! 


 And youre supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow! If anyone 
shouldnt go, its Harry, hes got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head C  

 Fine, Ill stay here, said Harry. Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, 
wont you? 

 As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on Harrys forehead. 
His hand jumped to it. He saw Hermiones eyes narrow, and he tried to pass off the 
movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes. 

 Well, if all three of us go well have to Disapparate separately, Ron was saying. 
We cant all fit under the Cloak anymore. 

 Harrys scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up. At once, 
Kreacher hurried forward. 

 Master has not finished his soup, would master prefer the savory stew, or else the 
treacle tart to which Master is so partial? 

 Thanks, Kreacher, but Ill be back in a minute C er C bathroom. 

 Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up the stairs 
to the hall and then to the first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the 
door again. Grunting with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form 
of open-mouthed serpents and closed his eyes . 

 He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side of him had high, 
timbered gables; they looked like gingerbread houses. He approached one of them, then 
saw the whiteness of his own long-fingered hand against the door. He knocked. He felt a 
mounting excitement  

 The door opened: A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as she looked into 
Harrys face: humor gone, terror replacing it . 

 Gregorovitch? said a high, cold voice. 

 She shook her head: She was trying to close the door. A white hand held it steady, 
prevented her shutting him out  

 I want Gregorovitch. 

 Er wohnt hier nicht mehr! she cried, shaking her head. He no live here! He no 
live here! I know him not! 

 Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back away down the dark 
hall, and Harry followed, gliding toward her, and his long-fingered hand had drawn his 
wand. 

 where is he? 

 Das weiff ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not! 

 He raised his hand. She screamed. Two young children came running into the hall. 
She tried to shield them with her arms. There was a flash of green light C 

 Harry! HARRY! 

 He opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. Hermione was pounding on the door 
again. 

 Harry, open up! 

 He had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door; Hermione 
toppled inside at once, regained her balance, and looked around suspiciously. Ron was 
right behind her, looking unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly 
bathroom. 

 What were you doing? asked Hermione sternly. 


 What dyou think I was doing? asked Harry with feeble bravado. 

 You were yelling your head off! said Ron. 

 Oh yeah  I mustve dozed off or C  

 Harry, please dont insult our intelligence, said Hermione, taking deep breaths. 
We know your scar hurt downstairs, and youre white as a sheet. 

 Harry sat down on the edge of the bath. 

 Fine. Ive just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now hes probably killed 
her whole family. And he didnt need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were just there 
  

 Harry, you arent supposed to let this happen anymore! Hermione cried, her 
voice echoing through the bathroom. Dumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency! HE 
thought the connection was dangerous C Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to 
watch him kill and torture, how can it help? 

 Because it means I know what hes doing, said Harry. 

 So youre not even going to try to shut him out? 

 Hermione, I cant. You know Im lousy at Occlumency. I never got the hang of 
it. 

 You never really tried! she said hotly. I dont get it, Harry C do you like having 
this special connection or relationship or what C whatever C  

 She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up. 

 Like it? he said quietly. Would you like it? 

 I C no C Im sorry, Harry. I just didnt mean C  

 I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when 
hes most dangerous. But Im going to use it. 

 Dumbledore C 

 Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody elses. I want to know why hes 
after Gregorovitch. 

 Who? 

 Hes a foreign wandmaker, said Harry. He made Krums wand and Krum 
reckons hes brilliant. 

 But according to you, said Ron, Voldemorts got Ollivander locked up 
somewhere. If hes already got a wandmaker, what does he need another one for? 

 Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better  or else 
he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing 
me, because Ollivander didnt know. 

 Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione 
exchanging skeptical looks behind his back. 

 Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did, said Hermione, but you 
made it happen! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own 
power? 

 Because I know it wasnt me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both 
know what really happened! 

 They glared at each other; Harry knew that he had not convinced Hermione and 
that she was marshaling counterarguments, against both his theory on his wand and the 
fact that he was permitting himself to see into Voldemorts mind. To his relief, Ron 
intervened. 


 Drop it, he advised her. Its up to him. And if were going to the Ministry 
tomorrow, dont you reckon we should go over the plan? 

 Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the matter rest, though 
Harry was quite sure she would attack again at the first opportunity. In the meantime, 
they returned to the basement kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle 
tart. 

 They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going over and 
over their plan until they could recite it, word perfect, to each other. Harry, who was now 
sleeping in Siriuss room, lay in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph of 
his father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan to himself for another ten 
minutes. As he extinguished his wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, 
Puking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he though of 
Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while 
Voldemort sought him so determinedly. 

 Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste. 

 You look terrible, was Rons greeting as he entered the room to wake Harry. 

 Not for long, said Harry, yawning. 

 They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served coffee and 
hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry associated 
with exam review. 

 Robes, she said under her breath, acknowledging their presence with a nervous 
nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, Polyjuice Potion  Invisibiliity 
Cloak  Decoy Detonators  You should each take a couple just in case  Puking 
Pastilles, Nosebleed Norgat, Extendable Ears  

 They gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing them 
out and promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie ready for them when they returned. 

 Bless him, said Ron fondly, and when you think I used to fantasize about 
cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall. 

 They made their way onto the front step with immense caution. They could see a 
couple of puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the house from across the misty square. 

 Hermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for Harry. 

 After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found himself 
in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place. It was 
as yet deserted, except for a couple of large bins; the first Ministry workers did not 
usually appear here until at least eight oclock. 

 Right then, said Hermione, checking her watch. she ought to be here in about 
five minutes. When Ive Stunned her C 

 Hermione, we know, said Ron sternly. And I thought we were supposed to 
open the door before she got here? 

 Hermione squealed. 

 I nearly forgot! Stand back C 

 She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door beside 
them, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led, as they knew from 
their careful scouting trips, into an empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward 
her, to make it look as thought it was still closed. 


 And now, she said, turning, back to face the other two in the alleyway, we put 
on the Cloak again C 

 and we wait, Ron finished, throwing it over Hermiones head like a blanket 
over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry. 

 Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch 
with flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden 
brightness: the sun had just come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy 
the unexpected warmth, however, before Hermiones silent Stunning Spell hit her in the 
chest and she toppled over. 

 Nicely done, Hermione, said Ron, emerging behind a bin beside the theater 
door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the little witch into 
the dark passageway that led backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witchs 
head and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded 
bag. Ron was rummaging through the little witchs handbag. 

 Shes Mafalda Hopkirk, he said, reading a small card that identified their victim 
as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. Youd better take this, Hermione, 
and here are the tokens. 

 He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M., 
which he had taken from the witchs purse. 

 Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, 
and within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed 
Mafaldas spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch. 

 Were running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second. 

 They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and Ron threw the 
Invisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds 
later there was another pop, and a small, ferrety looking wizard appeared before them. 

 Oh, hello, Mafalda. 

 Hello! said Hermione in a quavery voice, How are you today? 

 Not so good, actually, replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly 
downcast. 

 As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along 
behind them. 

 Im sorry to hear youre under the weather, said Hermione, talking firmly over 
the little wizard and he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him 
from reaching the street. Here, have a sweet. 

 Eh? Oh, no thanks C 

 I insist! said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. 
Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one. 

 The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, the 
little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a 
handful of hairs from the top of his head. 

 Oh dear! she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. Perhaps youd better 
take the day off! 

 No C no! He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being 
unable to walk straight. I must C today C must go C  


 But thats just silly! said Hermione, alarmed. You cant go to work in this state 
C I think you ought to go to St. Mungos and get them to sort you out. 

 The wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the 
main street. 

 You simply cant go to work like this! cried Hermione. 

 At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a reposed Hermione to 
claw his way back into a standing position, he turned on the spot and vanished, leaving 
nothing behind but the bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying 
chunks of vomit. 

 Urgh, said Hermione, holding up the skirt of her robe to avoid the puddles of 
sick. It would have made much less mess to Stun him too. 

 Yeah, said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizards bag, but I 
still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on 
his job, though, isnt he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then. 

 Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick 
wizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag. 

 Weird he wasnt wearing them today, wasnt it, seeing how much he wanted to 
go? Anyway, Im Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back. 

 Now wait here, Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, 
and well be back with some hairs for you. 

 He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in 
the sick-splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron 
and Hermione reappeared. 

 We dont know who he is, Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black 
hairs, but hes gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, hes pretty tall, youll need 
bigger robes  

 She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry 
retired to take the potion and change. 

 Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, 
from what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a 
beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the 
other two. 

 Blimey, thats scary, said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him. 

 Take one of Mafaldas tokens, Hermione told Harry, and lets go, its nearly 
nine. 

 They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded 
pavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of stairs, one labeled 
GENTLEMEN, the other LADIES. 

 See you in a moment, then, said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down 
the steps to LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending 
into what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and 
white. 

 Morning, Reg! called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a 
cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. Blooming pain in the bum, 
this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry 
Potter? 


 The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle. 

 Yeah, he said, stupid, isnt it? 

 And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles. 

 To Harrys left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and 
peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted 
feet climbing into the toilet next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him. 

 We have to flush ourselves in? he whispered. 

 Looks like it, Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gravelly. 

 They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet. 

 He knew at once that he had done the right thing; thought he appeared to be 
standing in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the 
chain, and next moment had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into 
the Ministry of Magic. 

 He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. 
The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain 
had filled the center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished 
wooden floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was 
rather frightening, this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved 
thrones, looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. 
Engraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT. 

 Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs. Another wizard had just 
flown out of the fireplace behind him. 

 Out of the way, cant y C oh, sorry, Runcorn. 

 Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Apparently the man who 
Harry was impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating. 

 Psst! said a voice, and he looked around to see a whispy little witch and the 
ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. 
Harry hastened to join them. 

 You got in all right, then? Hermione whispered to Harry. 

 No, hes still stuck in the hog, said Ron. 

 Oh, very funny  Its horrible, isnt it? she said to Harry, who was staring up 
at the statue. Have you seen what theyre sitting on? 

 Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were 
decoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans: hundreds and 
hundreds of naked bodies, men, women, and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, 
twisted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards. 

 Muggles, whispered Hermione, In their rightful place. Come on, lets get 
going. 

 They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at 
the end of the hall, looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of 
the distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a 
smaller hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as 
many lifts. They had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said, Cattermole! 

 They looked around: Harrys stomach turned over. One of the Death Eaters who 
had witnessed Dumbledores death was striding toward them. The Ministry workers 
beside them fell silent, their eyes downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through them. 


The mans scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent, 
sweeping robes, which were embroidered with much gold thread. Someone in the crowd 
around the lifts called sycophantically, Morning, Yaxley! Yaxley ignored them. 

 I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office, 
Cattermole. Its still raining in there. 

 Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but nobody 
spoke. 

 Raining  in your office? Thats C thats not good, is it? 

 Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxleys eyes widened. 

 You think its funny, Cattermole, do you? 

 A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off. 

 No, said Ron, no, of course C 

 You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, 
Cattermole? In fact, Im quite surprised youre not down there holding her hand while 
she waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and 
marry a pureblood next time. 

 Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She cough 
feebly and turned away. 

 I C I C stammered Ron. 

 But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood, said Yaxley, not that any 
woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth C and the Head of Department of 
Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do this job, 
Cattermole. Do you understand me? 

 Yes, whispered Ron. 

 Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry within an 
hour, your wifes Blood Status will be in even greater doubt than it is now. 

 The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant smile to 
Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley 
swept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody 
followed them: It was as if they were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift 
began to move upward. 

 What am I going to do? Ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken. If 
I dont turn up, my wife  I mean, Cattermoles wife C  

 Well come with you, we should stick together C began Harry, but Ron shook 
his head feverishly. 

 Thats mental, we havent got much time. You two find Umbridge, Ill go and 
sort out Yaxleys office C but how do I stop a raining? 

 Try Finite Incantatem, said Hermione at once, that should stop the rain if its a 
hex or curse; if it doesnt somethings gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which 
will be more difficult to fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his 
belongings C  

 Say it again, slowly C  said Ron, searching his pockets desperately for a quill, 
but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt. A disembodied female voice said, Level 
four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating 
Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau, 


and the grilles slid open again, admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet 
paper airplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift. 

 Morning, Albert, said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. He glanced 
over at Ron and Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more; Hermione was now 
whispering frantic instructions to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and 
muttering Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert. Im pretty 
confident Ill get his job now! 

 He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice. The lift stopped; 
the grilles opened once more. 

 Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper 
Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services, 
said the disembodied witchs voice. 

 Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift, followed 
by the other wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The moment the golden door 
had closed Hermione said, very fast, Actually, Harry, I think Id better go after him, I 
dont think he knows what hes doing and if he gets caught the whole thing C  

 Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff. 

 The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four people stood 
before them, two of them deep in conversation: a long-haired wizard wearing magnificent 
robes of black and gold, and a squat, toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short 
hair and clutching a clipboard to her chest. 

 

Chapter Thirteen 

The Muggle-Born Registration Commission 

 

 Ah, Mafalda! said Umbridge, looking at Hermione. Travers sent you, did he? 

 Y-yes, squeaked Hermione. 

 God, youll do perfectly well. Umbridge spoke to the wizard in black and gold. 
Thats that problem solved. Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for record-keeping we 
shall be able to start straightaway. She consulted her clipboard. Ten people today and 
one of them the wife of a Ministry employee! Tut, tut even here, in the heart of the 
Ministry! She stepped into the lift besides Hermione, as did the two wizards who had 
been listening to Umbridges conversation with the Minister. Well go straight down, 
Mafalda, youll find everything you need in the courtroom. Good morning, Albert, arent 
you getting out? 

 Yes, of course, said Harry in Runcorns deep voice. 

 Harry stepped out of the life. The golden grilles clanged shut behind him. 
Glancing over his shoulder, Harry saw Hermiones anxious face sinking back out of sight, 
a tall wizard on either side of her, Umbridges velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder. 

 What brings you here, Runcorn? asked the new Minister of Magic. His long 
black hair and beard were streaked with silver and a great overhanging forehead 
shadowed his glinting eyes, putting Harry in the mind of a crab looking out from beneath 
a rock. 


 Needed a quick word with, Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, Arthur 
Weasley. Someone said he was up on level one. 

 Ah, said Plum Thicknesse. Has he been caught having contact with an 
Undesirable? 

 No, said Harry, his throat dry. No, nothing like that. 

 Ah, well. Its only a matter of time, said Thicknesse. If you ask me, the blood 
traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn. 

 Good day, Minister. 

 Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The 
moment the Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out 
from under his heavy black cloak, threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in 
the opposite direction. Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure 
his big feet were hidden. 

 Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming wooden door after 
gleaming wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owners name and 
occupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed 
to force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and 
Hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish. They had concentrated all 
their efforts on getting inside without being detected: They had not given a moments 
thought to what they would do if they were forced to separate. Now Hermione was stuck 
in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; Ron was struggling to do 
magic that Harry was sure was beyond him, a womans liberty possibly depending on the 
outcome, and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly 
well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift. 

 He stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide what to do. The 
silence pressed upon him: There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here the 
purple-carpeted corridors were as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast 
over the place. 

 Her office must be up here, Harry thought. 

 It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office, but 
on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He therefore set off 
along the corridor again, passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring 
instructions to a quill that floated in front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment. 

 Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner. Halfway 
along the next corridor he emerged into a wide, open space where a dozen witches and 
wizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly 
polished and free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite 
mesmerizing. They were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of 
colored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites. After a few seconds, 
Harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed the 
same pattern and after a few more seconds he realized what he was watching was the 
creation of pamphlets C that the paper squares were pages, which, when assembled, 
folded and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard. 

 Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing 
that he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed 


pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility 
Cloak. Its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title: 

 

Mudbloods 

and the Dangers They Pose to 

a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society 

 

 Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of 
its petals, being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. There was no authors 
name upon the pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to 
tingle as he examined it. Then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she 
said, still waving and twirling her wand, Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all 
day, does anyone know? 

 Careful, said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages 
slipped and fell to the floor. 

 What, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now? 

 The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of 
pamphlet-makers; Harry looked too, and the rage reared in him like a snake. Where there 
might have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue 
iris had been set into the wood C an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had 
known Alastor Moody. 

 For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there: He 
even forgot that he was invisible. He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. 
It was not moving. It gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read: 

 

Dolores Umbridge 

Senior Undersecretary to the Minister 

 

 Below that a slightly shinier new plaque read: 

 

Head of the Muggle-Born 

Registration Commission 

 

 Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though they were intent upon 
their work, he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty 
office opened in front of them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object 
with little waving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the 
Cloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground. 

 It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of 
him. A few moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob, 
there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid smoke billowed from a corner. The 
young witch in the front row shrieked: Pink pages flew everywhere as she and her 
fellows jumped up, looking around for the source of the commotion. Harry turned the 
doorknob, stepped into Umbridges office, and closed the door behind him. 


 He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbridges office 
at Hogwarts: Lace draperies, doilies and dried flowers covered every surface. The walls 
bore the same ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, beribboned kitten, 
gamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a flouncy, 
flowered cloth. Behind Mad-eyes eye, a telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy 
on the workers on the other side of the door. Harry took a look through it and saw that 
they were all still gathered around the Decoy Detonator. He wrenched the telescope out 
of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the magical eyeball out of it, and placed it in his 
pocket. The he turned to face the room again, raised his wand, and murmured, Accio 
Locker. 

 Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Umbridge knew all 
about protective charms and spells. He therefore hurried behind her desk and began 
pulling open all the drawers. He saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted 
paper clips that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had be beaten back; a fussy little 
lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no sign of a locket. 

 There was a filing cabinet behind the desk: Harry set to searching it. Like Filchs 
filing cabinet at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with a name. It was not 
until Harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from 
the search: Mr. Weasleys file. 

 He pulled it out and opened it. 

 

Arthur Weasley 

Blood Status: 

Pureblood, but with unacceptable pro-Muggle 
leanings. Known member of the Order of the 
Phoenix. 

Family: 

Wife (pureblood), seven children, two 
youngest at Hogwarts. NB: Youngest son 
currently at home, seriously ill, Ministry 
inspectors have confirmed. 

Security Status: 

TRACKED. All movements are being 
monitored. Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 
1 will contact (has stayed with Weasley 
family previously) 



 

 Undesirable Number One, Harry muttered under his breath as he replaced Mr. 
Weasleys folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew who that was, and sure 
enough, as he straightened up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places he 
saw a poster of himself on the wall, with the words UNDESIRABLE NO. 1 emblazoned 
across his chest. A little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. 
Harry moved across to read it and saw that Umbridge had written, To be punished. 

 Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets 
of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there. He gave the 
office one last sweeping look, and his heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at 
him from a small rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk. 

 Harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realized that the moment 
he touched it that it was not a mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the 


front cover of a glossy book. Harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing 
across his hat C The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore C nor the slightly smaller writing 
across his chest: by Rita Skeeter, bestselling author of Armando Dippet: Master or 
Moron? 

 Harry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two teenage 
boys, both laughing immoderately with their arms around each others shoulders. 
Dumbledore, now with elbow-length hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the 
one on Krums chin that had so annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in silent amusement 
beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild look about him. His golden hair fell in curls to his 
shoulders. Harry wondered whether it was a young Doge, but before he could check the 
caption, the door of the office opened. 

 If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry would 
not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over himself. As it was, he thought 
Thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two he 
remained quite still, staring curiously at the place where Harry had just vanished. Perhaps 
deciding that that all he had seen was Dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the 
book, for Harry had hastily replaced it upon the shelf. Thicknesse finally walked to the 
desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot. It sprang out and 
began scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly, hardly daring to breathe, Harry 
backed out of the office into the open area beyond. 

 The pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of the Decoy 
Detonator, which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry hurried off up the corridor 
as the young witch said, I bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, theyre so 
careless, remember that poisonous duck? 

 Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had never been 
likely that the locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of bewitching its 
whereabouts out of Umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority 
now had to be to leave the Ministry before they were exposed, and try again another day. 
The first thing to do was to find Ron, and then they could work out a way of extracting 
Hermione from the courtroom. 

 The lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in and pulled off the Invisibility 
Cloak as it started its descent. To his enormous relief, when it rattled to a halt at level two, 
a soaking-wet and wild-eyed Ron got in. 

 M-morning, he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again. 

 Ron, its me, Harry! 

 Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like C why isnt Hermione with you? 

 She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she couldnt refuse, and C
 

 But before Harry could finish the lift had stopped again. The doors opened and 
Mr. Weasley walked inside, talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so 
high it resembled an anthill. 

  I quite understand what youre saying, Wakanda, but Im afraid I cannot be 
party to C  

 Mr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very strange to have Mr. 
Weasley glare at him with that much dislike. The lift doors closed and the four of them 
trundled downward once more. 


 Oh hello, Reg, said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound of steady 
dripping from Rons robes. Isnt your wife in for questioning today? Er C whats 
happened to you? Why are you so wet? 

 Yaxleys office is raining, said Ron. He addressed Mr. Weasleys shoulder, and 
Harry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly 
into each others eyes. I couldnt stop it, so theyve sent me to get Bernie C Pillsworth, I 
think they said C 

 Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately, said Mr. Weasley. Did you try 
Meterolojinx Recanto? It worked for Bletchley. 

 Meteolojinx Recanto? whispered Ron. No, I didnt. Thanks, D C I mean, 
thanks, Arthur. 

 The lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left, and Ron darted past 
her out of sight. Harry made to follow him, but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley 
strode into the lift, his nose buried in some papers he was reading. 

 Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he was in a lit with 
his father. He glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and left the lift the 
moment the doors opened again. For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time 
found his way blocked by Mr. Weasleys arm. 

 One moment, Runcorn. 

 The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr. Weasley said, 
I hear you had information about Dirk Cresswell. 

 Harry had the impression that Mr. Weasleys anger was no less because of the 
brush with Percy. He decided his best chance was to act stupid. 

 Sorry? he said. 

 Dont pretend, Runcorn, said Mr. Weasley fiercely. You tracked down the 
wizard who faked his family tree, didnt you? 

 I C so what if I did? said Harry. 

 So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are, said Mr. Weasley quietly, as 
the lift sank ever lower. And if he survives Azkaban, youll have to answer to him, not 
to mention his wife, his sons, and his friends C 

 Arthur, Harry interrupted, you know youre being tracked, dont you? 

 Is that a threat, Runcorn? said Mr. Weasley loudly. 

 No, said Harry, its a fact! Theyre watching your every move C 

 The lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr. Weasley gave Harry a 
scathing look and swept from the lift. Harry stood there, shaken. He wished he was 
impersonating somebody other than Runcorn. The lift doors clanged shut. 

 Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He would try to 
extricate Hermione on his own while Ron was dealing with the raining office. When the 
doors opened, he stepped out into a torch-lit stone passageway quite different from the 
wood-paneled and carpeted corridors above. As the left rattled away again, Harry 
shivered slightly, looking toward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the 
Department of Mysteries. 

 He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remembered on 
the left hand side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers. His 
mind grappled with possibilities as he crept down them: He still had a couple of Decoy 
Detonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter 


as Runcorn, and ask for a quick word with Mafalda? Of course, he did not know whether 
Runcorn was sufficiently important to get away with this, and even if he managed it, 
Hermiones non-reappearance might trigger a search before they were clear of the 
Ministry. 

 Lost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was 
creeping over him, as if he were descending into fog. It was becoming colder and colder 
with every step he took; a cold that reached right down his throat and tore at his lungs. 
And then he felt that stealing sense of despair, or hopelessness, filling him, expanding 
inside him. 

 Dementors, he thought. 

 And as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful 
scene. The dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall, black-hooded 
figures, their faces completely hidden, their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. 
The petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard 
wooden benches. Most of them were hiding their faces in their hands, perhaps in an 
instinctive attempt to shield themselves from the dementors greedy mouths. Some were 
accompanied by families, others sat alone. The dementors were gliding up and down in 
front of them, and the cold, and the hopelessness, and the despair of the place laid 
themselves upon Harry like a curse. 

 Fight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure a Patronus here 
without revealing himself instantly. So he moved forward as silently as he could, and 
with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to 
think of Hermione and of Ron, who needed him. 

 Moving through the towering black figures was terrifying: The eyeless faces 
hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed, and he felt sure that they sensed him, 
sensed, perhaps, a human presence that still had some hope, some resilience. 

 And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the dungeon 
doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it. 

 No, no, Im half-blood, Im half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard, he 
was, look him up, Arkie Alderton, hes a well known broomstick designer, look him up, I 
tell you C get your hands off me, get your hands off C 

 This is your final warning, said Umbridges soft voice, magically magnified so 
that it sounded clearly over the mans desperate screams. If you struggle, you will be 
subjected to the Dementors Kiss. 

 The mans screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor. 

 Take him away, said Umbridge. 

 Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their rotting, scabbed 
hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting. They glided 
away down the corridor with him, and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed 
him from sight. 

 Next C Mary Cattermole, called Umbridge. 

 A small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot. Her dark hair was 
smoothed back into a bun and she wore long plain robes. Her face was completely 
bloodless. As she passed the dementors, Harry saw her shudder. 


 Spare us, spat Yaxley. The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our sympathies. 

 Mrs. Cattermoles sobs masked Harrys footsteps as he made his way carefully 
toward the steps that led up to the raised platform. The moment he had passed the place 
where the Patronus cat patrolled, he felt the change in temperature: It was warm and 
comfortable here. The Patronus, he was sure, was Umbridges, and it glowed brightly 
because she was so happy here, in her element, upholding the twisted laws she had 
helped to write. Slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind 
Umbridge, Yaxley, and Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about 
making Hermione jump. He thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon Umbridge and 
Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause Hermione alarm. Then Umbridge 
raised her voice to address Mrs. Cattermole, and Harry seized his chance. 

 Im behind you, he whispered into Hermiones ear. 

 As he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of 
ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Umbridge and 
Yaxley were concentrating upon Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed. 

 A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. 
Cattermole, Umbridge was saying. Eight-and-three-quarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair 
core. Do you recognize the description? 

 Mrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve. 

 Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand? 

 He did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated the sight of her 
walking alone into the dungeon: As the door began to swing closed, he slipped into the 
courtroom behind her. 

 It was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use 
of magic. This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high it gave the 
claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well. 

 There were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura over the place; 
they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high, raised platform. 
Here, behind a balustrade, sat Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of her, and Hermione, 
quite as white-faced as Mrs. Cattermole, on the other. At the foot of the platform, a bight-
silver, long-haired cat prowled up and down, up and down, and Harry realized that it was 
there to protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors: That 
was for the accused to feel, not the accusers. 

 Sit down, said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice. 

 Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the 
raised platform. The moment she had sat down, chains clinked out of the arms of the 
chair and bound her there. 

 You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole? asked Umbridge. 

 Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod. 

 Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Department? 

 Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears. 

 I dont know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here! 

 Umbridge ignored her. 

 Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred Cattermole? 
Mrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever. 

 Theyre frightened, they think that I might not come home C 


 T-took? sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. I didnt t-take it from anybody. I b-bought it 
when I was eleven years old. It C it C it C chose me. 

 She cried harder than ever. 

 Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her. She 
leaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and something gold 
swung forward too, and dangled over the void: the locket. 

 Hermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and Yaxley, still 
intent upon their prey, were deaf to everything else. 

 No, said Umbridge, no, I dont think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose 
witches or wizards. You are not a witch. I have your responses to the questionnaire that 
was sent to you here C Mafalda, pass them to me. 

 Umbridge held out a small hand: She looked so toadlike at that moment that 
Harry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. Hermiones hands 
were shaking with shock. She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair 
beside her, finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs. Cattermoles name on it. 

 Thats C thats pretty, Dolores, she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the 
ruffled folds of Umbridges blouse. 

 What? snapped Umbridge, glancing down. Oh yes C an old family heirloom, 
she said, patting the locket lying on her large bosom. The S stands for Selwyn. I am 
related to the Selwyns. Indeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not 
related. A pity, she continued in a louder voice, flicking through Mrs. Cattermoles 
questionnaire, that the same cannot be said for you. Parents professions: 
greengrocers. 

 Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and 
the dementors stood waiting in the corners. 

 It was Umbridges lie that brought the blood surging into Harrys brain and 
obliterated his sense of caution C that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty 
criminal was being used to bolster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, 
not even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, 
Stupefy! 

 There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge 
of the balustrade: Mrs. Cattermoles papers slid off her lap onto the floor and, down 
below, the prowling silver cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind: 
Yaxley, confused, looked around for the source of the trouble and saw Harrys 
disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried to draw his own wand, but too late: 
Stupefy! 

 Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor. 

 Harry! 

 Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend C 

 Harry, Mrs. Cattermole! 

 Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below, the 
dementors had moved out of their corners; they were gliding toward the woman chained 
to the chair: Whether because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their 
masters were no longer in control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint. Mrs. 
Cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and 
forced her face back. 


 EXPECTO PATRONUM! 

 The silver stag soared from the tip of Harrys wand and leaped toward the 
dementors, which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again. The stags light, 
more powerful and more warming than the cats protection, filled the whole dungeon as it 
cantered around the room. 

 Get the Horcrux, Harry told Hermione. 

 He ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak into his back, and 
approached Mrs. Cattermole. 

 You? she whispered, gazing into his face. But C but Reg said you were the one 
who submitted my name for questioning! 

 Did I? muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her arms, Well, Ive had 
a change of heart. Diffindo! Nothing happened. Hermione, how do I get rid of these 
chains? 
Wait, Im trying something up here C 

 Hermione, were surrounded by dementors! 

 I know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the lockets gone C I need to 
duplicate it C Geminio! There That should fool her. 

 Hermione came running downstairs. 

 Lets see. Relashio! 

 The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. Mrs. Cattermole 
looked just as frightened as ever before. 

 I dont understand, she whispered. 

 Youre going to leave here with us, said Harry, pulling her to her feet. Go 
home, grab your children, and get out, get out of the country if youve got to. Disguise 
yourselves and run. Youve seen how it is, you wont get anything like a fair hearing 
here. 

 Harry, said Hermione, how are we going to get out of here with all those 
dementors outside the door? 

 Patronuses, said Harry, pointing his wand at his own. The stag slowed and 
walked, still gleaming brightly, toward the door. As many as we can muster; do yours, 
Hermione. 

 Expec C Expecto patronum, said Hermione. Nothing happened. 

 Its the only spell she ever has trouble with, Harry told a completely bemused 
Mrs. Cattermole. Bit unfortunate, really Come on Hermione. 

 Expecto patronum! 

 A silver otter burst from the end of Hermiones wand and swam gracefully 
through the air to join the stag. 

 Cmon, said Harry, and he led Hermione and Mrs. Cattermole to the door. 

 When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the 
people waiting outside. Harry looked around; the dementors were falling back on both 
sides of them, melding into the darkness, scattering before the silver creatures. 

 Its been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your 
families, Harry told the waiting Muggle-born, who were dazzled by the light of the 
Patronuses and still cowering slightly. Go abroad if you can. Just get well away from the 
Ministry. Thats the C er C new official position. Now, if youll just follow the Patronuses, 
youll be able to leave the Atrium. 


 They managed to get up the stone stops without being intercepted, but as they 
approached the lifts Harry started to have misgivings. If they emerged into the Atrium 
with a silver stag, and otter soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them 
accused Muggle-borns, he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted 
attention. He had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt 
in front of them. 

 Reg! screamed Mrs. Cattermole, and she threw herself into Rons arms. 
Runcorn let me out, he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and hes told all of us to leave 
the country. I think wed better do it, Reg, I really do, lets hurry home and fetch the 
children and C why are you so wet? 

 Water, muttered Ron, disengaging himself. Harry, they know there are 
intruders inside the Ministry, something about a hole in Umbridges office door. I reckon 
weve got five minutes if that C 

 Hermiones Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror struck face to 
Harry. 

 Harry, if were trapped here C ! 

 We wont be if we move fast, said Harry. He addressed the silent group behind 
them, who were all gawping at him. 

 Whos got wands? 

 About half of them raised their hands. 

 Okay, all of you who havent got wands need to attach yourself to somebody 
who has. Well need to be fast before they stop us. Come on. 

 They managed to cram themselves into two lifts. Harrys Patronus stood sentinel 
before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise. 

 Level eight, said the witchs cool voice, Atrium. 

 Harry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was full of people 
moving from fireplace to fireplace, sealing them off. 

 Harry! squeaked Hermione. What are we going to C ? 

 STOP! Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of Runcorn echoed through the 
Atrium: The wizards sealing the fireplaces froze. Follow me, he whispered to the group 
of terrified Muggle-borns, who moved forward in a huddle, shepherded by Ron and 
Hermione. 

 Whats up, Albert? said the same balding wizard who had followed Harry out 
of the fireplace earlier. He looked nervous. 

 This lot need to leave before you seal the exits, said Harry with all the authority 
he could muster. 

 The group of wizards in front of him looked at one another. 

 Weve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone C 

 Are you contradicting me? Harry blustered. Would you like me to have your 
family tree examined, like I had Dirk Cresswells? 

 Sorry! gasped the balding wizard, backing away. I didnt mean nothing, Albert, 
but I thought I thought they were in for questioning and 

 Their blood is pure, said Harry, and his deep voice echoed impressively through 
the hall. Purer than many of yours, I daresay. Off you go, he boomed to the Muggle-
borns, who scurried forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry 
wizards hung back, some looking confused, others scared and fearful. Then: 


 Mary! 

 Mrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Cattermole, no longer 
vomiting but pale and wan, had just come running out of a lift. 

 R- Reg? 

 She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly. 

 The balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one Reg Cattermole 
to the other. 

 Hey C whats going on? What is this? 

 Seal the exit! SEAL IT! 

 Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the 
fireplaces, into which all of the Muggle-borns but Mrs. Cattermole had now vanished. As 
the balding wizard lifted his wand, Harry raised an enormous fist and punched him, 
sending him flying through the air. 

 Hes been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley! Harry shouted. 

 The balding wizards colleagues set up and uproar, under cover of which Ron 
grabbed Mrs. Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open fireplace, and disappeared. 
Confused, Yaxley looked from Harry to the punched wizard, while the real Reg 
Cattermole screamed, My wife! Who was that with my wife? Whats going on? 

 Harry saw Yaxleys head turn, saw an inkling of truth dawn on that brutish face. 

 Come on! Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into 
the fireplace together as Yaxleys curse sailed over Harrys head. They spun for a few 
seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle. Harry flung open the door: Ron 
was standing there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole. 

 Reg, I dont understand C 

 Let go, Im not your husband, youve got to go home! 

 There was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked around; Yaxley had 
just appeared. 

 LETS GO! Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by the arm 
and turned on the stop. 

 Darkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing hands, but 
something was wrong. Hermiones hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip. 

 He wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he could not breathe or see and 
the only solid things in the world were Rons arm and Hermiones fingers, which were 
slowly slipping away. 

 And then he saw the door to number twelve, Grimmauld Place, with its serpent 
door knocker, but before he could draw breath, there was a scream and a flash of purple 
light: Hermiones hand was suddenly vicelike upon his and everything went dark again. 

Chapter Fourteen 

The Thief 

 

Harry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green; he had no idea what 
had happened, he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs. 
Struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened, he blinked and realized that the 
gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him. Then an 


object twitched close to his face. He pushed himself onto his hands and knees, ready to 
face some small, fierce creature, but saw that the object was Rons foot. Looking around, 
Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest floor, apparently alone. 

 Harrys first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, even though 
he knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of 
Hogwarts, his heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrids hut. 
However, in the few moments it took for Ron to give a low groan and Harry to start 
crawling toward him, he realized that this was not the Forbidden Forest; The trees looked 
younger, they were more widely spaced, the ground clearer. 

 He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Rons head. The moment his 
eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harrys mind, for blood drenched the whole of 
Rons left side and his face stood out, grayish-white, against the leaf-strewn earth. The 
Polyjuice Potion was wearing off now: Ron was halfway between Cattermole and himself 
in appearance, his hair turning redder and redder as his face drained of the little color it 
had left. 

 Whats happened to him? 

 Splinched, said Hermione, her fingers already busy at Rons sleeve, where the 
blood was wettest and darkest. 

 Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Rons short. He had always thought of 
Splinching as something comical, but this . . . His insides crawled unpleasantly as 
Hermione laid bare Rons upper arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped 
cleanly away as though by a knife. 

 Harry, quickly, in my bag, theres a small bottle labeled Essence of DittanyC  

 Bag C right C 

 Harry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, 
and thrust his hand inside it. At once, object after object began presenting itself to his 
touch: He felt the leather spines of books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes C 

 Quickly! 

 He grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the 
magical bag. 

 Accio Dittany! 

 A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and hastened back to 
Hermione and Ron, whose eyes were now half-closed, strips of white eyeball all that 
were visible between his lids. 

 Hes fainted, said Hermione, who was also rather pale; she no longer looked 
like Mafalda, though her hair was still gray in places. Unstopper it for me, Harry, my 
hands are shaking. 

 Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took it and poured three 
drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound. Greenish smoke billowed upward and when 
it had cleared, Harry saw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several 
days old; new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh. 

 Wow, said Harry. 

 Its all I feel safe doing, said Hermione shakily. There are spells that would put 
him completely right, but I darent try in case I do them wrong and cause more 
damage. . . . Hes lost so much blood already. . . . 


 How did he get hurt? I mean C Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, to make 
sense of whatever had just taken place C why are we here? I thought we were going back 
to Grimmauld Place? 

 Hermione took a deep breath. She looked close to tears. 

 Harry, I dont think were going to be able to go back there. 

 What dyou C ? 

 As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldnt get rid of him, he 
was too strong, and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and 
then C well, I think he must have seen the door, and thought we were stopping there, so 
he slackened his grip and I managed to sake him off and I brought us here instead! 

 But then, wheres he? Hang on. . . . You dont mean hes at Grimmauld Place? 
He cant get in there? 

 Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded. 

 Harry, I think he can. I C I forced him to let go with a Revulsion Jinx, but Id 
already taken him inside the Fidelius Charms protection. Since Dumbledore died, were 
Secret-Keepers, so Ive given him the secret, havent I? 

 There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious blow. If 
Yaxley could now get inside the house, there was no way that they could return. Even 
now, he could be bringing other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and 
oppressive though the house was, it had been their one safe refuge; even, now that 
Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of home. With a twinge of regret 
that had nothing to do with food, Harry imagined the house-elf busying himself over the 
steak-and-kidney pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat. 

 Harry, Im sorry, Im so sorry! 

 Dont be stupid, it wasnt your fault! If anything, it was mine. . . . 

 Harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eyes eye. Hermione recoiled, 
looking horrified. 

 Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people. I couldnt leave it 
there . . . but thats how they knew there were intruders. 

 Before Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and opened his eyes. He was still 
gray and his face glistened with sweat. 

 How dyou feel? Hermione whispered. 

 Lousy, croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm. Where are we? 

 In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup, said Hermione. I 
wanted somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this was C 

 C the first place you thought of, Harry finished for her, glancing around at the 
apparently deserted glade. He could not help remembering what had happened the last 
time they had Apparated to the first place Hermione had thought of C how Death Eaters 
had found them within minutes. Had it been Legilimency? Did Voldemort or his 
henchmen know, even now, where Hermione had taken them? 

 Dyou reckon we should move on? Ron asked Harry, and Harry could tell by 
the look on Rons face that he was thinking the same. 

 I dunno. 
Ron still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked 
as though he was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was daunting. 

 Lets stay here for now, Harry said. 


 Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet. 

 Where are you going? asked Ron. 

 If were staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place, 
she replied, and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and 
Ron, murmuring incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the 
surrounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing. 

 Salvio Hexia . . . Protego Totalum . . . Repello Muggletum . . . Muffliato . . . You 
could get out the tent, Harry. . . . 

 Tent? 

 In the bag! 

 In the . . . of course, said Harry. 

 He did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm. 
The tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, ropes, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly 
because of the smell of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the 
Quidditch World Cup. 

 I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry? he asked, starting 
to disentangle the pent pegs. 

 Apparently he didnt want it back, his lumbagos so bad, said Hermione, now 
performing complicated figure-of-eight movements with her wand. so Rons dad said I 
could borrow it. Erecto! she added, pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in 
one fluid motion rose into the air and settled, fully constructed, onto the ground before 
Harry, out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared, to land with a final thud at the end 
of a guy rope. 

 Cave Inimicum, Hermione finished with a skyward flourish. Thats as much as 
I can do. At the very least, we should know theyre coming; I cant guarantee it will keep 
out Vol C 

 Dont say the name! Ron cut across her, his voice harsh. 

 Harry and Hermione looked at each other. 

 Im sorry, Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them, but it 
feels like a C a jinx or something. Cant we call him You-Know-Who C please? 

 Dumbledore said fear of a name C began Harry. 

 In case you hadnt noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his name didnt do 
Dumbledore much good in the end, Ron snapped back. Just C just show You-Know-
Who some respect, will you? 

 Respect? Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning look; apparently he 
was not to argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition. 

 Harry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the entrance of the 
tent. The interior was exactly as Harry remembered it; a small flat, complete with 
bathroom and tiny kitchen. He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully 
onto the lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter 
still, and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not 
speak for a while. 

 Ill make some tea, said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from 
the depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen. 


 Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that 
Mad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. After 
a minute or two, Ron broke the silence. 

 What dyou reckon happened to the Cattermoles? 

 With any luck, theyll have got away, said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for 
comfort. As long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits about him, hell have transported Mrs. 
Cattermole by Side-Along-Apparition and theyll be fleeing the country right now with 
their children. Thats what Harry told her to do. 

 Blimey, I hope they escaped, said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. The tea 
seemed to be doing him good; a little of his color had returned. I didnt get the feeling 
Reg Cattermole was all that quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me 
when I was him. God, I hope they made it. . . . If they both end up in Azkaban because of 
us . . . 

 Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had been about to ask C about 
whether Mrs. Cattermoles lack of a wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her 
husband C died in his throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the 
Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if 
he had surprised her in the act of kissing him. 

 So, have you got it? Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was there. 

 Got C got what? she said with a little start. 

 What did we just go through all that for? The locket! Wheres the locket? 

 You got it? shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his pillows. No one 
tells me anything! Blimey, you could have mentioned it! 
Well, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters, werent we? said 
Hermione. Here. 

 And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron. 

 It was as large as a chickens egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid with many small green 
stones, glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tents canvas roof. 

 There isnt any chance someones destroyed it since Kreacher had it? asked 
Ron hopefully. I mean, are we sure its still a Horcrux? 

 I think so, said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it closely. 
Thered be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed. 

 She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The thing looked perfect, 
pristine. He remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and how the stone in the 
Horcrux ring had been cracked open when Dumbledore destroyed it. 

 I reckon Kreachers right, said Harry. Were going to have to work out how to 
open this thing before we can destroy it. 

 Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden 
doors, hit Harry as he spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to 
fling the locket from him. Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with 
his fingers, then attempted the charm Hermione had used to open Reguluss bedroom 
door. Neither worked. He handed the locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom 
did their best, but were no more successful at opening it than he had been. 

 Can you feel it, though? Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he held it tight in his 
clenched fist. 


 What dyou mean? 
Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or two, Harry thought he knew 
what Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing through his veins that he could feel, or 
was it something beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal heart? 

 What are we going to do with it? Hermione asked. 

 Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it. Harry replied, and, little though 
he wanted to, he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out of sight 
beneath his robes, where it rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given 
him. 

 I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent, he added to 
Hermione, standing up and stretching. And well need to think about some food as well. 
You stay there, he added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of 
green. 

 With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully 
upon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role 
of lookout. However, the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and 
whether because of the protective enchantments and Muggle-repelling charms Hermione 
had spread around them, or because people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood 
remained deserted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought no change; 
Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at ten oclock, and looked out 
upon a deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of 
starry sky visible from their protected clearing. 

 He felt hungry now, and a little light-headed. Hermione had not packed any food 
in her magical bag, as she had assumed that they would be returning to Grimmauld Place 
that night, so they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermione 
had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a Billycan. After a couple of 
mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion away, looking queasy; Harry had only persevered 
so as to not hurt Hermiones feelings. 

 The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like 
crackings of twigs: Harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people, 
yet he kept his wand held tight at the ready. His insides, already uncomfortable due to 
their inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms, tingled with unease. 

 He had though that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, 
but somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness, of which his 
wand lit only a tiny part, was worry about what would happen next. It was as though he 
had been hurtling toward this point for weeks, months, maybe even years, but how he had 
come to an abrupt halt, run out of road. 

 There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did not have the faintest 
idea where they could be. He did not even know what all of them were. Meanwhile he 
was at a loss to know how to destroy the only one that they had found, the Horcrux that 
currently lay against the bare flesh of his chest. Curiously, it had not taken heat from his 
body, but lay so cold against his skin it might just have emerged from icy water. From 
time to time Harry thought, or perhaps imagined, that he could feel the tiny heartbeat 
ticking irregularly alongside his own. Nameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat 
there in the dark. He tried to resist them, push them away, yet they came at him 
relentlessly. Neither can live while the other survives. Ron and Hermione, now talking 


softly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to: He could not. And it 
seemed to Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that the 
Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left. . . . Stupid idea, he told 
himself, dont think that. . . . 

 His scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid that he was making it happen 
by having these thoughts, and tried to direct them into another channel. He thought of 
poor Kreacher, who had expected them home and had received Yaxley instead. Would 
the elf keep silent or would he tell the Death Eater everything he knew? Harry wanted to 
believe that Kreacher had changed towards him in the past month, that he would be loyal 
now, but who knew what would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick 
images swarmed into Harrys head and he tried to push these away too, for there was 
nothing he could do for Kreacher: He and Hermione had already decided against trying to 
summon him; what if someone from the Ministry came too? They could not count on 
elfish Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to Grimmauld 
Place on the hem of Hermiones sleeve. 

 Harrys scar was burning now. He thought that there was so much they did not 
know: Lupin had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined. Why 
hadnt Dumbledore explained more? Had he thought that there would be time; that he 
would live for years, for centuries perhaps, like his friend Nicolas Flamel? If so, he had 
been wrong. . . . Snape had seen to that. . . . Snape, the sleeping snake, who had struck at 
the top of the tower . . . 

 And Dumbledore had fallen . . . fallen . . . 

 Give it to me, Gregorovitch. 

 Harrys voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held in front of him by a long-
fingered white hand. The man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in 
midair, though there were no ropes holding him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily 
bound, his limbs wrapped about him, his terrified face, on a level with Harrys ruddy due 
to the blood that had rushed to his head. He had pure-white hair and a thick, bushy beard: 
a trussed-up Father Christmas. 

 I have it not, I have it no more! It was, many years ago, stolen from me! 

 Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He knows. . . . He always knows. 
The hanging mans pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they seemed to swell, 
bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed Harry whole C 

 And how Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gregorovitchs 
wake as he held a lantern aloft: Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage 
and his lantern illuminated what looked like a workshop; wood shavings and gold 
gleamed in the swinging pool of light, and there on the window ledge sat perched, like a 
giant bird, a young man with golden hair. In the split second that the lanterns light 
illuminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a 
Stunning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window with a 
crow of laughter. 

 And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnellike pupils and 
Gregorovitchs face was stricken with terror. 

 Who was the thief, Gregorovitch? said the high cold voice. 

 I do not know, I never knew, a young man C no C please C PLEASE! 

 A scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light C 


 Harry! 

 He opened his eyes, panting, his forehead throbbing. He had passed out against 
the side of the tent, had slid sideways down the canvas, and was sprawled on the ground. 
He looked up at Hermione, whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible 
through the dark branches high above them. 

 Dream, he said, sitting up quickly and attempting to meet Hermiones glower 
with a look of innocence. Mustve dozed off, sorry. 

 I know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your face! You were looking 
into Vol C 

 Dont say his name! came Rons angry voice from the depths of the tent. 

 Fine, retorted Hermione, You-Know-Whos mind, then! 
I didnt mean it to happen! Harry said. It was a dream! Can you control what 
you dream about, Hermione? 

 If you just learned to apply Occlumency C 

 But Harry was not interested in being told off; he wanted to discuss what he had 
just seen. 

 Hes found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think hes killed him, but before he 
killed him he read Gregorovitchs mind and I saw C 

 I think Id better take over the watch if youre so tired youre falling sleep, said 
Hermione coldly. 

 I can finish the watch! 

 No, youre obviously exhausted. Go and lie down. 

 She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn. Angry, but wishing 
to avoid a row, Harry ducked back inside. 

 Rons still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry climbed into the 
one above him, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling. After several 
moments, Ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to Hermione, huddle in the 
entrance. 

 Whats You-Know-Who doing? 

 Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered 
into the darkness. 

 He found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing him. 
Hows Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if hes tied up? 

 I dunno. . . . Its weird, isnt it? 

 Harry closed his eyes, thinking of all that he had seen and heard. The more he 
recalled, the less sense it made. . . . Voldemort had said nothing about Harrys wand, 
nothing about the twin cores, nothing about Gregorovitch making a new and more 
powerful wand to beat Harrys. . . . 

 He wanted something from Gregorovitch, Harry said, eyes still closed tight. 
He asked him to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him . . . and 
then . . . then . . . 

 He remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to hurtle through 
Gregorovitchs eyes, into his memories. . . . 

 He read Gregorovitchs mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a 
windowsill, and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. He stole it, he 
stole whatever You-Know-Whos after. And I . . . I think Ive seen him somewhere. . . . 


 Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boys face. The theft 
had happened many years ago, according to Gregorovitch. Why did the young thief look 
familiar? 

 The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent; all Harry could 
hear was Rons breathing. After a while, Ron whispered, Couldnt you see what the 
thief was holding? 

 No . . . it mustve been something small. 

 Harry? 

 The wooden slats of Rons bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed. 

 Harry, you dont reckon You-Know-Whos after something else to turn into a 
Horcrux? 

 I dont know, said Harry slowly. Maybe. But wouldnt it be dangerous for him 
to make another one? Didnt Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already? 

 Yeah, but maybe he doesnt know that. 

 Yeah . . .maybe, said Harry. 

 He had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way around the problem 
of the twin cores, sure that Voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker . . . and 
yet he had killed him, apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore. 

 What was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the Ministry of Magic and the 
Wizarding world at his feet, was he far away, intent on the pursuit of an object that 
Gregorovitch had once owned, and which had been stolen by the unknown thief? 

 Harry could still see the blond-haired youths face; it was merry, wild; there was a 
Fred and George-ish air of triumphant trickery about him. He had soared from the 
windowsill like a bird, and Harry had seen him before, but he could not think where. . . . 

 With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger now, and 
it was on him that Harrys thoughts dwelled, as Rons snores began to rumble from the 
lower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more. 

 

Chapter Fifteen 

The Goblins Revenge 

 

 Early next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search 
the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could 
find. There in its shadows he buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye and marked the spot by 
gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that 
Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge's door. 
Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were 
going to do next. 

 Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron 
agreed, wit the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon 
sandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the 
clearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground 
that might show they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a 
small market town. 


 Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and 
surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments. Harry ventured out under the 
Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely 
entered the town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of 
the skies made him freeze where he stood. 

"But you can make a brilliant Patronus!" protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the 
tent empty handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors. 

 "I couldn't . . . make one." he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. "Wouldn't . . . 
come." 

Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had 
been a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the must in the 
distance and realizing, as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming 
filled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry's 
willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide 
amongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the 
despair they cast wherever they went. 

 "So we still haven't got any food." 

 "Shut up, Ron," snapped Hermione. "Harry, what happened? Why do you think 
you couldn't make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!" 

 "I don't know." 

 He sat low in one of Perkins's old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the 
moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a 
long time ago: Today me might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who 
collapsed on the Hogwarts Express. 

 Ron kicked a chair leg. 

 "What?" he snarled at Hermione. "I'm starving! All I've had since I bled half to 
death is a couple of toadstools!" 

 "You go and fight your way through the dementors, then," said Harry, stung. 

 "I would, but my arm's in a sling, in case you hadn't noticed!" 

 "That's convenient." 

 "And what's that supposed to  ?" 

 "Of course!" cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both 
of them into silence. "Harry, give me the locket! Come on," she said impatiently, clicking 
her fingers at him when he did not react," to Horcrux, Harry, you're still wearing it!" 

 She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head. The 
moment it parted contact with Harry's skin he free and oddly light. He had not even 
realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach 
until both sensations lifted. 

 "Better?" asked Hermione. 

 "Yeah, loads better!" 

 "Harry," she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he 
associated with visiting the very sick, "you don't think you've been possessed, do you?" 

 "What? No!" he said defensively, "I remember everything we've done while I've 
bee wearing it. I wouldn't know what I'd done if I'd been possessed, would I? Ginny told 
me there were times when she couldn't remember anything." 


 "Hmm," said Hermione, looking down at the heavy locket. "Well, maybe we 
ought not to wear it. We can just keep it in the tent." 

 "We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around," Harry stated firmly. "If we lose it, 
if it gets stolen" 

 "Oh, all right, all right," said Hermione, and she placed it around her own neck 
and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt. "But we'll take turns wearing it, so 
nobody keeps it on too long." 

 "Great," said Ron irritably, "and now we've sorted that out, can we please get 
some food?" 

 "Fine, but we'll go somewhere else to find it," said Hermione with half a glance at 
Harry. "There's no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around." 

 In the end they settled down for the night in a far flung field belonging to a lonely 
farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread. 

 "It's not stealing, is it?" asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they devoured 
scrambled eggs on toast. "Not if I left some money under the chicken coo?" 

 Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, "Er-my-nee, 'oo worry 'oo 
much. 'Elax!" 

 And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed. 
The argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt 
cheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first of the three night watches. 

 This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits, 
an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, because be had 
suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys. Hermione bore up reasonably well on 
those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her 
temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences dour. Ron, however, had 
always been used to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the 
Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible. Whenever 
lack of food coincided with Ron's turn to wear the Horcrux, he became downright 
unpleasant. 

 "So where next?" was his constant refrain. He did not seem to have any ideas 
himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and 
brooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless 
hours trying to decide where they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the 
one they already got, their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they got no 
new information. 

 As Dumbledore had told Harry that be believed Voldemort had hidden the 
Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those 
locations they knew that Voldemort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had 
been born and raised: Hogwarts, where he had been educated; Borgin and Burks, where 
he had worked after completing school; then Albania, where he had spent his years of 
exile: These formed the basis of their speculations. 

 "Yeah, let's go to Albania. Shouldn't take more than an afternoon to search an 
entire country," said Ron sarcastically. 

 "There can't be anything there. He'd already made five of his Horcruxes before he 
went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth," said Hermione. "We 
know the snake's not in Albania, it's usually with Vol" 


 "Didn't I ask you to stop say that?" 

 "Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Whohappy?" 

 "Not particularly." 

 "I can't see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes." said Harry, who had made 
this point many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. "Borgin 
and Burke were experts at Dark objects, they would've recognized a Horcrux 
straightaway." 

 Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, 
Harry plowed on, "I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts." 

 Hermione sighed. 

 "But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!" 

 Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory. 

 "Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwart's 
secrets. I'm telling you, if there was one place Vol" 

 "Oi!" 

 "YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!" Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. "If there was 
one place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!" 

 "Oh, come on," scoffed Ron. "His school?" 

 "Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special: 
it meant everything to him, and even after he left" 

 "This is You-Know-Who we're talking about, right? Not you?" inquired Ron. He 
was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck; Harry was visited by a desire to 
seize it and throttle him. 

 "You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he 
left," said Hermione. 

 "That's right," said Harry. 

 "And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something, 
probably another founder's object, to make into another Horcrux?" 

 Yeah, said Harry. 

 But he didnt get the job, did he? said Hermione. So he never got the chance to 
find a founders object there and hide it in the school! 

 Okay, then, said Harry, defeated. Forget Hogwarts. 

 Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the 
Invisibility Cloak, search for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised. 
Hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that the place had been 
demolished many years before. They visited its site and found a tower block of offices. 

 We could try digging in to foundations? Hermione suggested halfheartedly. 

 He wouldnt have hidden a Horcrux here, Harry said. He had known it all along. 
The orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape; he would 
never have hidden a part of his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort 
sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was 
as far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts of the Ministry or a building like 
Gringotts, the Wizarding banks, with its gilded doors and marble floors. 

 Even without any new idea, they continued to move through the countryside, 
pitching the tent in a different place each night for security. Every morning they made 
sure that they had removed all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely 


and secluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of 
cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly 
cove. Every twelve hours or so they passed the Horcrux between them as though they 
were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where they dreaded 
the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety. 

 Harrys scare kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when he was 
wearing the Horcrux. Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain. 

 What? What did you see? demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry wince. 

 A face, muttered Harry, every time. The same face. The thief who stole from 
Gregorovitch. 

 And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment. Harry 
knew that Ron was hoping to bear news of his family or the rest of the Order of the 
Phoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what 
Voldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy. Apparently 
Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose 
name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than he did. As 
Harrys scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in his 
memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other two showed 
nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, 
when they were so desperate for a lean on the Horcruxes. 

 As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and Hermione 
were having conversations without, and about, him. Several times they stopped talking 
abruptly when Harry entered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled 
a little distance away, heads together and talking fast; both times they fell silent when 
they realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or 
water. 

 Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what 
now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret 
plan that they would learn in due course. Ton was making no effort to hide his bad mood, 
and Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. 
In desperation he tried to think of further Horcrux locations, but the only one that 
continued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of the others thought this at all 
likely, he stopped suggesting it. 

 Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it. They were now 
pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those cast by the 
dementors; wind and rain added to their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting 
better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing 
isolation, the lack of other peoples company, or their total ignorance of what was going 
on in the war against Voldemort. 

 My mother, said Ron on night, as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in Wales, 
can make good food appear out of thin air. 

 He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate. Harry glanced 
automatically at Rons neck and saw, as he has expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux 
glinting there. He managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude 
would, he knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket. 


 Your mother cant produce food out of thin air, said Hermione. no one can. 
Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamps Law of Elemental 
Transfigura 

 Oh, speak English, cant you? Ron said, prising a fish out from between his 
teeth. 

 Its impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you 
know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if youve already got 
some 

 Well, dont bother increasing this, its disgusting, said Ron. 

 Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice Im always the one who 
ends up sorting out the food, because Im a girl, I suppose! 

 No, its because youre supposed to be the best at magic! shot back Ron. 

 Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto the floor. 

 You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and 
charm them into something worth eating, and Ill sit here and pull faces and moan and 
you can see you 

 Shut up!, said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands. Shut up 
now! 

 Hermione looked outraged. 

 How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook 

 Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone! 

 He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk. Then, over 
the rush and gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He looked around 
at the Sneakoscope. It was not moving. 

 You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right? he whispered to Hermione. 

 I did everything, she whispered back, Muffliato, Muggle-Repelling and 
Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldnt be able to hear of see us, whoever they 
are. 

 Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs, 
told them that several people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope that 
descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, 
waiting. The enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient, in the 
near total darkness, to shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal witches and 
wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested 
by Dark Magic for the first time. 

 The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached 
the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the 
cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag 
and started to rummage; after a moment she drew out three Extendible Ears and threw 
one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh-colored strings into 
their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance. 

 Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice. 

 There ought to be a few salmon in here, or dyou reckon its too early in the 
season? Accio Salmon! 

 There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against 
flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed the Extendable ear deeper into his 


own: Over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices, but they were not 
speaking English or any human language he had ever heard. It was a rough and 
unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there seemed to be two 
speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other. 

 A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas, large shadows passed 
between tent and flames. The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in 
their direction. Then came the clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again. 

 Here, Griphook, Gornuk. 

 Goblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded. 

 Thank you, said the goblins together in English. 

 So, you three have been on the run how long? asked a new, mellow, and 
pleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-
faced man. 

 Six weeks . . . Seven . . . I forget, said the tired man. Met up with Griphook in 
the first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a but 
of company. There was a pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked 
up and replaced on the ground. What made you leave, Ted? continued the man. 

 Knew they were coming for me, replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry 
suddenly knew who he was: Tonkss father. Heard Death Eaters were in the area last 
week and decided Id better run for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, 
see, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew Id have to leave in the end. My wife should 
be okay, shes pure-blood. And then I net Dean here, what, a few days ago, son? 

 Yeah, said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each other, 
silent but besides themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean 
Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor. 

 Muggle-born, eh? asked the first man. 

 Not sure , said Dean. My dad left my mum when I was a kid. Ive got no proof 
he was a wizard, though. 

 There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching; then Ted spoke 
again. 

 Ive got to say, Dirk, Im surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word 
was that youd been caught. 

 I was, said Dirk. I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it. 
Stunned Dawlish, and nicked his broom. It was easier than youd think; I dont reckon 
hes quite right at the moment .Might be Confunded. If so, Id like to shake the hand of 
the witch or wizard who did it, probably saved my life. 

 There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on. The 
Ted said, And where do you two fit in? I, er, had the impression the goblins were for 
You-Know-Who, on the whole. 

 You had a false impression, said the higher-voiced of the goblins. We take no 
sides. This is a wizards war. 

 How come youre in hiding, then? 

 I deemed in prudent, said the deeper-voiced goblin. Having refused what I 
considered an impertinent request, I could see that my person safety was in jeopardy. 

 What did they ask you to do? asked Ted. 


 Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race, replied the goblin, his voice rougher 
and less human as he said it. I am not a house-elf. 

 What about you, Griphook? 

 Similar reasons, said the higher voiced goblin. Gringotts is no longer under the 
sole control of my race. I recognize no Wizarding master. 

 He added something under his breath in Gobbledegook, and Gornuk laughed. 

 Whats the joke? asked Dean. 

 He said, replied Dirk, that there are things wizards dont recognize, either. 

 There was a short pause. 

 I dont get it, said Dean. 

 I had my small revenge before I left,, said Griphook in English. 

 Good mangoblin, I should say, amended Ted hastily. Didnt manage to lock 
a Death Eater up in one of the old high-security vaults, I suppose? 

 If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out, replied Griphook. 
Gornuk laughed again and even Dirk gave a dry chuckle. 

 Dean and I are still missing something here, said Ted. 

 So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it, said Griphook, and the two 
goblins roared with malicious laughter. Inside the tent Harrys breathing was shallow 
with excitement: He and Hermione stared at each other, listening as hard as they could. 

 Didnt you hear about that, Ted? asked Dirk. About the kids who tried to steal 
Gryffindors sword out of Snapes office at Hogwarts? 

 An electric current seemed to course through Harry, jangling his every nerve as he 
stood rooted to the spot. 

 Never heard a word, said Ted, Not in the Prophet, was it? 

 Hardly, chortled Dirk. Griphook here told me, he heard about it from Bill 
Weasley who works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bills 
younger sister. 

 Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were clutching the 
Extendable Ears as tightly as lifelines. 

 She and a couple of friends got into Snapes office and smashed open the glass 
case where he was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught them as they were trying 
to smuggle it down the staircase. 

 Ah, God bless em, said Ted. What did they think, that theyd be able to use 
the sword on You-Know-Who? Or on Snape himself? 

 Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape decided the 
sword wasnt safe where it was, said Dirk. Couple of days later, once hed got the say-
so from You-Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts 
instead. 

 The goblins started to laugh again. 

 Im still not seeing the joke, said Ted. 

 Its a fake, rasped Griphook. 

 The sword of Gryffindor! 

 Oh yes. It is a copyen excellent copy, it is truebut it was Wizard-made. The 
original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin-made 
armor possesses. Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at 
Gringotts bank. 


 I see, said Ted. And I take it you didnt bother telling the Death Eaters this/ 

 I saw no reason to trouble them with the information, said Griphook smugly, 
and now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirks laughter. 

 Inside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask the question he 
needed answered, and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged: he was (Harry 
remembered with a jolt) an ex-boyfriend of Ginnys too. 

 What happened to Ginny and all the others? The ones who tried to steal it? 

 Oh, they were punished, and cruelly, said Griphook indifferently. 

 Theyre okay, though? asked Ted quickly, I mean, the Weasleys dont need 
any more of their kids injured, do they? 

 They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware, said Griphook. 

 Lucky for them, said Ted. With Snapes track record I suppose we should just 
be glad theyre still alive. 

 You believe that story, then, do you, Ted? asked Dirk. You believe Snape 
killed Dumbledore? 

 Course I do, said Ted. Youre not going to sit there and tell me you think 
Potter had anything to do with it? 

 Hard to know what to believe these days, muttered Dirk. 

 I know Harry Potter, said Dean. And I reckon hes the real thingthe Chosen 
One, or whatever you want to call it. 

 Yeah, theres a lot would like to believe hes that, son, said Dirk, me included. 
But where is he? Run for it, by the looks of things. Youd think if he knew anything we 
dont, or had anything special going for him, hed be out there now fighting, rallying 
resistance, instead of hiding. And you know, the Prophet made a pretty good case against 
him 

 The Prophet? scoffed Ted. You deserve to be lied to if youre still reading that 
much, Dirk. You want the facts, try the Quibbler. 

 There was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a good deal of 
thumping, by the sound of it. Dirk had swallowed a fish bone. At last he sputtered, The 
Quibbler? That lunatic rag of Xeno Lovegoods? 

 Its not so lunatic these days, said Ted. You want to give it a look, Xeno is 
printing all the stuff the Prophets ignoring, not a single mention of Crumple-Horned 
Snorkacks in the last issue. How long theyll let him get with it, mind, I dont know. But 
Xeno says, front page of every issue, that any wizard whos against You-Know-Who 
ought to make helping Harry Potter their number-one priority. 

 Hard to help a boy whos vanished off the face of the earth, said Dirk. 

 Listen, the fact that they havent caught him yets one hell of an achievement, 
said Ted. Id take tips from him gladly; its what were trying to do, stay free, isnt it? 

 Yeah, well, youve got a point there, said Dirk heavily. With the whole of the 
Ministry and all their informers looking for him, Id have expected him to be caught by 
now. Mind, whos to say they havent already caught and killed him without publicizing 
it? 

 Ah, dont say that, Dirk, murmured Ted. 

 There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks. When they 
spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the back or retreat back up 


the wooded slope. Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, 
then clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away. 

 Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who had found 
the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found 
himself unable to say more then, Ginnythe sword 

 I know! said Hermione. 

 She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right up to the 
armpit. 

 Here . . . we . . . are . . . she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at 
something that was evidently in the depths of the bag. Slowly the edge of an ornate 
picture frame came into sight. Harry hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait 
of Phineas Nigellus free of Hermiones bag, she kept her wand pointing at it, ready to 
cast a spell at any moment. 

 If somebody swapped the real sword for the face while it was in Dumbledores 
office, she panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, Phineas 
Nigellus would have seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case! 

 Unless he was asleep, said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt 
down in front of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then 
said: 

 ErPhineas? Phineas Nigellus? 

 Nothing happened. 

 Phineas Nigellus? said Hermione again. Professor Black? Please could we talk 
to you? Please? 

 Please always helps, said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus slid into 
his portrait. At one, Hermione cried: 

 Obscura! 

 A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigelluss clever, dark eyes, causing 
him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain. 

 Whathow darewhat are you? 

 Im very sorry, Professor Black, said Hermione, but its a necessary 
precaution! 

 remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a great work 
of art! Where am I? What is going on? 

 Never mind where we are, said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus froze, abandoning 
his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold. 

 Can that possible be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter? 

 Maybe, said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigelluss interest. 
Weve got a couple of questions to ask youabout the sword of Gryffindor. 

 Ah, said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and that in an effort to 
catch sight of Harry, yes. That silly girl acted most unwisely there 

 Shut up about my sister, said Ron roughly, Phineas Nigellus raised supercilious 
eyebrows. 

 Who else is here? he asked, turning his head from side to side. Your tone 
displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardily in the extreme. Thieving from 
the headmaster. 

 They werent thieving, said Harry. That sword isnt Snapes. 


 It belongs to Professor Snapes school, said Phineas Nigellus. Exactly what 
claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot 
Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity! 

 Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity! said Hermione. 

 Where am I? repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold 
again. Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my 
forebears? 

 never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna? asked Harry 
urgently. 

 Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the 
oaf, Hagrid. 

 Hagrids not an oaf! said Hermione shrilly. 

 And Snape mightve though that was a punishment, said Harry, buy Ginny, 
Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest . . . 
theyve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal! 

 He felt relieved; he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus Curse at the very 
least. 

 What we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether anyone else has, um, 
taken out the sword at all? Maybe its been taken away for cleaningor something! 

 Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered. 

 Muggle-born, he said, Goblin-made armor does not require cleaning, simple 
girl. Goblins silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens it. 

 Dont call Hermione simple, said Harry. 

 I grow weary of contradiction, said Phineas Nigellus. perhaps it is time for me 
to return to the headmasters office.? 

 Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to feel his way out 
of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden inspiration. 

 Dumbledore! Cant you bring us Dumbledore? 

 I beg your pardon? asked Phineas Nigellus. 

 Professor Dumbledores portraitcouldnt you bring him along, here, into 
yours? 

 Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harrys voice. 

 Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter. The portraits of 
Hogwarts may commune with each other, but they cannot travel outside of the castle 
except to visit a painting of themselves elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with 
me, and after the treatment I have received at your hands, I can assure you that I will not 
be making a return visit! 

 Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave his 
frame. 

 Professor Black, said Hermione, couldnt you just tell us, please, when was the 
last time the sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny took it out, I mean? 

 Phineas snorted impatiently. 

 I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when 
Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring. 

 Hermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them dared say more in 
front of Phineas Nigellus, who had at least managed to locate the exit. 


 Well, good night to you, he said a little waspishly, and he began to move out of 
sight again. Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden 
shout. 

 Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this? 

 Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture. 

 Professor Snape has more important things on his mind that the many 
eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter! 

 And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but his murky 
backdrop. 

 Harry! Hermione cried. 

 I know! Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the air; it was 
more than he had dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could 
have run a mile; he did not even feel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing Phineas 
Nigelluss back into the beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag 
aside and raised a shining face to Harry. 

 The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which 
strengthens themHarry, that swords impregnated with basilisk venom! 

 And Dumbledore didnt five it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use 
it on the locket 

 and he must have realized they wouldnt let you have it if he put it in his 
will 

 so he made a copy 

 and put a fake in the glass case 

 and he left the real onewhere? 

 They gazed at east other Harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the 
air above them, tantalizingly close. Why hadnt Dumbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, 
told Harry, but Harry had not realized it at the time? 

 Think! whispered Hermione. Think! Where would he have left it? 

 Not at Hogwarts, said Harry, resuming his pacing. 

 Somewhere in Hogsmeade? suggested Hermione. 

 The Shrieking Shack? said Harry. Nobody ever goes in there. 

 But Snape knows how to get in, wouldnt that be a bit risky? 

 Dumbledore trusted Snape, Harry reminded her. 

 Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords, said Hermione. 

 Yeah, youre right! said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at the thought 
that Dumbledore had had some reservations, however faint, about Snapes 
trustworthiness. So, would he have hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade, then? 
What dyou reckon, Ron? Ron? 

 Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron had left 
the tent, then realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a bunk, looking stony. 

 Oh, remembered me, have you? he said. 

 What? 

 Ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk. 

 You two carry on. Dont let me spoil your fun. 

 Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook her head, apparently 
as nonplussed as he was. 


 Whats the problem? asked Harry. 

 Problem? Theres no problem, said Ron, still refusing to look at Harry. Not 
according to you, anyways. 

 There were several plunks on the canvas over their heads. It had started to rain. 

 Well, youve obviously got a problem, said Harry. Spit it out, will you? 

 Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean, unlike himself. 

 All right, Ill spit it out. Dont expect me to skip up and down the tent because 
theres some other damn thing weve got to find. Just add it to the list of stuff you dont 
know. 

 I dont know? repeated Harry. I dont know? 

 Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier; it pattered on the 
leaf-strewn bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark. Dread 
doused Harrys jubilation; Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him 
to be thinking. 

 Its not like Im not having the time of my life here, said Ron, you know, with 
my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just 
hoped, you know, after wed been running round a few weeks, wed have achieved 
something. 

 Ron, Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend not to 
have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was beating on the tent. 

 I thought you knew what youd signed up for, said Harry. 

 Yeah, I thought I did too. 

 So what part of it isnt living up to your expectations? asked Harry. Anger was 
coming to his defense now. Did you think wed be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a 
Horcrux every other day? Did you think youd be back to Mummy by Christmas? 

 We thought you knew what you were doing! shouted Ron, standing up, and his 
words Harry like scalding knives. We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we 
thought you had a real plan! 

 Ron! said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the 
tent roof, but again, he ignored her. 

 Well, sorry to let you down, said Harry, his voice quite calm even though he 
felt hollow, inadequate. Ive been straight with you from the start. I told you everything 
Dumbledore told me. And in the case you havent noticed, weve found one Horcrux 

 Yeah, and were about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of 
themnowhere effing near in other words. 

 take off the locket, Ron, Hermione said, her voice unusually high. Please take 
it off. You wouldnt be talking like this if you hadnt been wearing it all day. 

 Yeah, he would, said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron. Dyou 
think I havent noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? Dyou think I didnt 
guess you were thinking this stuff? 

 Harry, we werent 

 Dont lie! Ron hurled at her. You said it too, you said you were disappointed, 
you said youd thought he had a bit more to go on than 

 I didnt say it like thatHarry, I didnt! she cried. 

 The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermiones face, and 
the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a short-lived 


firework that had flared and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of 
Gryffindor was hidden they knew not where, and their were three teenagers in a tent 
whose only achievement was not, yet, to be dead. 

 So why are you still here? Harry asked Ron. 

 Search me, said Ron. 

 Go home then, said Harry. 

 Yeah, maybe I will! shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward Harry, who 
did not back away. Didnt you hear what they said about my sister? But you dont give a 
rats fart, do you, its only the Forbidden Forest, Harry Ive-Faced-Worse Potter doesnt 
care what happened to her in therewell, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff 

 I was only sayingshe was with the others, they were with Hagrid 

 Yeah, I get it, you dont care! And what about the rest of my family, the 
Weasleys dont need another kid injured, did you hear that? Yeah, I 

 Not bothered what it meant, though? 

 Ron! said Hermione, forcing her way between them. I dont think it means 
anything new has happened, anything we dont know about; think, Ron, Bills already 
scared, plenty of people must have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and youre 
supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, Im sure thats all he meant 

 Oh, youre sure, are you? Right then, well, I wont bother myself about them. 
Its all right for you, isnt it, with your parents safely out of the way 

 My parents are dead! Harry bellowed. 

 And mine could be going the same way! yelled Ron. 

 Then GO! roared Harry. Go back to them, pretend youre got over your 
spattergroit and Mummyll be able to feed you up and 

 Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was clear of 
its owners pocket, Hermione had raised her own. 

 Prestego! she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on 
the one side and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the 
strength of the spell, and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier 
as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive 
hatred toward Ron: Something had broken between them. 

 Leave the Horcrux, Harry said. 

 Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. 
He turned to Hermione. 

 What are you doing? 

 What do you mean? 

 Are you staying, or what? 

 I . . . She looked anguished. Yesyes, Im staying. Ron, we said wed go with 
Harry, we said wed help 

 I get it. You choose him. 

 Ron, nopleasecome back, come back! 

 She was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the time she had removed it he 
had already stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and silent, listening to her 
sobbing and calling Rons name amongst the trees. 

 After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face. 

 Hes g-g-gone! Disapparated! 


 She threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry. 

 Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around his 
own neck. He dragged blankets off Rons bunk and threw them over Hermione. Then he 
climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding 
of the rain. 

 

Chapter Sixteen 

Godrics Hollow 

 

 When Harry woke the following day it was several seconds before he 
remembered what had happened. Then he hoped childishly, that it had been a dream, that 
Ron was still there and had never left. Yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see 
Ron's deserted bunk. It was like a dead body in the way it seems to draw his eyes. Harry 
jumped down from his own bed, keeping his eyes averted from Ron's. Hermione, who 
was already busy in the kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning, but turned 

her face away quickly as he went by. He's gone, Harry told himself. He's gone. He had to 
keep thinking it as he washed and dressed as though repetition would dull the shock of it. 
He's gone and he's not coming back. And that was the simple truth of it, Harry knew, 
because their protective enchantments meant that it would be impossible, once they 
vacated this spot, for Ron to find them again. He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. 
Hermione's eyes were puffy and red; she looked as if she had not slept. They packed up 
their things, Hermione dawdling. Harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on 
the riverbank; several times he saw her look up eagerly, and he was sure she had deluded 
herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain, but no red-haired 
figure appeared between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her, looked around ( for he 
could not help hoping a little, himself) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods, another 
little parcel of fury exploded inside him. He could hear Ron saying, "We thought you 
knew what you were doing!", and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his 
stomach. 

 The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their 
bank. They had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their 
campsite. Finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times, Hermione seemed 
unable to find any more reasons to delay: She and Harry gasped hands and Disapparated, 
reappearing on a windswept heather-covered hillside. The instant they arrived, Hermione 
dropped Harry's hand and walked away from him, finally sitting down on a large rock, 
her face on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs. He watched her, supposing 
that he ought to go and comfort her, but something kept him rooted to the spot. 
Everything inside him felt cold and tight: Again he saw the contemptuous expression on 
Ron's face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the 
distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spell she usually performed to ensure their 
protection. 

 They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was determined never to 
mention his name again and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the 
issue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her 


crying. Meanwhile Harry had started bringing out the Marauder's map and examining it 
by wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when Ron's labeled dot would reappear in 
the corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle, 
protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear on the map and after a 
while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny's name in the girl's 
dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into 
her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was 
all right. 

 By day, hey devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of 
Gryffindor's sword, but the more they talked about the places in which Dumbledore 
might have hidden it, the more desperate and far-fetched their speculation became. 
Cudgel his brains though he might, Harry could not remember Dumbledore ever 
mentioning a place in which he might hide something. There were moments when he did 
not know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore. We thought you knew 
what you were doing ...We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do ... We thought 
you had a real plan! 

He could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right. Dumbledore had left him 
with virtually nothing. They had discovered one Horcrux, but they had no means of 
destroying it: The others were as unattainable as they had ever been. Hopelessness 
threatened to engulf him. He was staggered now to think of his own presumption in 
accepting his friends' offers to accompany him on this meandering, pointless journey. he 
knew nothing, he had no ideas, and he was constantly, painfully on the alert for any 
indications that Hermione too was about to tell him that she had had enough. That she 
was leaving. 

 They were spending many evenings in near silence and Hermione took to bringing out 
Phineas Nigellus's portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of 
the gaping hole left by Ron's departure. Despite his previous assertion that he would 
never visit them again, Phineas Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out 
more about what Harry was up to and consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days 
of so. Harry was even glad to see him, because he was company, albeit of a snide and 
taunting kind. They relished any news about what was happening at Hogwarts, though 
Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated Snape, the first Slytherin 
headmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and they had to be careful not to 
criticize or ask impertinent questions about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly 
leave his painting. 

However, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be facing a constant, 
low level of mutiny from a hard core of students. Ginny had been banned from going into 
Hogsmeade. Snape had reinstated Umbridge's old decree forbidding gatherings of three 
or more students or any unofficial student societies. From all of these things, Harry 
deduced that Ginny, and probably Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their 
best to continue Dumbledore's Army. This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so 
badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him think of Ron again, and of 
Dumbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as his ex-girlfriend. 
Indeed, as Phineas Niggellus talked about Snape's crackdown, Harry experienced a split 
second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the 
destabilization of Snapes regime: Being fed and having a soft bad, and other people 


being in charge, seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at this moment. But 
then he remembered that he was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten-thousand 
Galleon price on his head, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as 
dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic. Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently 
emphasized this fact my slipping in leading questions about Harry and 
Hermione's whereabouts. Hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time 
he did this, and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after 
these unceremonious good-byes. 

The weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in any area too 
long, so rather than staying in the south of England, where a hard ground frost was the 
worst of their worries, they continued to meander up and down the country, braving a 
mountainside, where sleet pounded the tent; a wide, flat marsh, where the tent was 
flooded with chill water; and a tiny island in the middle of a Scottish loch, where snow 
half buried the tent in the night. They had already spotted Christmas Trees twinkling 
from several sitting room windows before there came an evening when Harry resolved to 
suggest again, what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them. They had 
just eaten an unusually good meal: Hermione had been to a supermarket under the 
Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left), and 
Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of 
spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears. 

He had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours break from 
wearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him. 

 Hermione? 

 Hmm? She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with The Tales of 
Beedle the Bard. He could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book, 
which was not, after all, very long, but evidently she was still deciphering something in it, 
because Spellmans Syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair. 

 Harry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the occasion, several 
years previously, when he had asked Professor McGonagall whether he could go into 
Hogsmeade, despite the fact that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his 
permission slip. 

 Hermione, Ive been thinking, and C 

 Harry, could you help me with something? 
Apparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned forward and held out 
The Tales of Beedle the Bard. 

 Look at that symbol, she said, pointing to the top of a page. Above what Harry 
assumed was the title of the story (being unable to read runes, he could not be sure), there 
was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line. 

 I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione. 

 I know that; but it isnt a rune and its not in the syllabary, either. All along I 
thought it was a picture of an eye, but I dont think it is! Its been inked in, look, 
somebodys drawn it there, it isnt really part of the book. Think, have you ever seen it 
before? 
No . . . No, wait a moment. Harry looked closer. Isnt it the same symbol 
Lunas dad was wearing round his neck? 


 Well, thats what I thought too! 
Then its Grindelwalds mark. 

 She stared at him, openmouthed. 

 What? 

 Krum told me . . . 
He recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him at the wedding. Hermione 
looked astonished. 

 Grindelwalds mark? 

 She looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back again. Ive never heard that 
Grindelwald had a mark. Theres no mention of it in anything Ive ever read about him. 

 Well, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at Durmstrang, 
and Grindelwald put it there. 
She fell back into the old armchair, frowning. 

 Thats very odd. If its a symbol of Dark Magic, whats it doing in a book of 
childrens stories? 

 Yeah, it is weird, said Harry. And youd think Scrimgeour would have 
recognized it. He was Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff. 
I know. . . . Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All the other stories 
have little pictures over the titles. 
She did not speak, but continued to pore over the strange mark. Harry tried again. 

 Hermione? 

 Hmm? 

 Ive been thinking. I C I want to go to Godrics Hollow. 

 She looked up at him, but her eyes were unfocused, and he was sure she was still 
thinking about the mysterious mark on the book. 

 Yes, she said. Yes, Ive been wondering that too. I really think well have to. 

 Did you hear me right? he asked. 

 Of course I did. You want to go to Godrics Hollow. I agree. I think we should. I 
mean, I cant think of anywhere else it could be either. Itll be dangerous, but the more I 
think about it, the more likely it seems its there. 
Er C whats there? asked Harry. 

 At that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt. 

 Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known youd want to go back 
there, and I mean, Godrics Hollow is Godric Gryffindors birthplace C 

 Really? Gryffindor came from Godrics Hollow? 
Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic? 

 Erm, he said, smiling for what felt like the first time in months: The muscles in 
his face felt oddly stiff. I mightve opened it, you know, when I bought it . . . just the 
once. . . . 

 Well, as the village is named after him Id have thought you might have made 
the connection, said Hermione. She sounded much more like her old self than she had 
done of late; Harry half expected her to announce that she was off to the library. Theres 
a bit about the village in A History of Magic, wait . . . 

 She opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while, finally extracting her copy 
of their old school textbook, A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot, which she thumbed 
through until finding the page she wanted. 


 Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689, wizards went 
into hiding for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they formed their own small 
communities within a community. Many small villages and hamlets attracted several 
magical families, who banded together for mutual support and protection. The villages of 
Tinworsh in Cornwall, Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south 
coast of England were notable homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside 
tolerant and sometimes Confunded Muggles. Most celebrated of these half-magical 
dwelling places is, perhaps, Godrics Hollow, the West Country village where the great 
wizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright, Wizarding smith, forged 
the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families, 
and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little 
church beside it for many centuries. 

 You and your parents arent mentioned. Hermione said, closing the book, 
because Professor Bagshot doesnt cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth 
century. But you see? Godrics Hollow, Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindors sword; dont 
you think Dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection? 

 Oh yeah . . . 

 Harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all 
when he suggested they go to Godrics Hollow. For him, the lore of the village lay in his 
parents graves, the house where he had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of 
Bathilda Bagshot. 

 Remember what Muriel said? he asked eventually. 

 Who? 

 You know, he hesitated. He did not want to say Rons name. Ginnys great-
aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles. 

 Oh, said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had sensed 
Rons name in the offing. He rushed on: 

 She said Bathilda Bagshot still lived in Godrics Hollow. 

 Bathilda Bagshot, murmured Hermione, running her index finger over 
Bathildas embossed name on the front cover of A History of Magic. Well, I suppose C 

 She gasped so dramatically that Harrys insides turned over; he drew his wand, 
looking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the 
entrance flap, but there was nothing there. 

 What? he said, half angry, half relieved. What did you do that for? I thought 
youd seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent, at least C 

 Harry, what if Bathildas got the sword? What if Dumbledore entrusted it to 
her? 

 Harry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely old woman by 
now, and according to Muriel, she was gaga. Was it likely that Dumbledore would 
have hidden the sword of Gryffindor with her? If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left 
a great deal to chance: Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword 
with a fake, nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now, however, 
was not the moment to cast doubt on Hermiones theory, not when she was so 
surprisingly willing to fall in with Harrys dearest wish. 

 Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godrics Hollow? 


 Yes, but well have to think it through carefully, Harry. She was sitting up now, 
and Harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much 
as his. Well need to practice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a 
start, and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too, unless you think we 
should go the whole hog and use Polyjuice Potion? In that case well need to collect hair 
from somebody. I actually think wed better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises the 
better. . . . 

 Harry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause, but his mind 
had left the conversation. For the first time since he had discovered that the sword in 
Gringotts was a fake, he felt excited. 

 He was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had had a family. 
It was in Godrics Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and spent 
every school holiday. He could have invited friends to his house. . . . He might even have 
had brothers and sisters. . . . It would have been his mother who had made his 
seventeenth birthday cake. The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as 
at this moment, when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken 
from him. After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his 
rucksack from Hermiones beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid 
had given him so long ago. For the first time in months, he perused the old pictures of his 
parents, smiling and waving up at him from the images, which were all he had left of 
them now. 

 Harry would gladly have set out for Godrics Hollow the following day, but 
Hermione had other ideas. Convinced as she was that Voldemort would expect Harry to 
return to the scene of his parents deaths, she was determined that they would set off only 
after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a full 
week later C once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who 
were Christmas shopping, and had practiced Apparating and Disapparating while 
underneath the Invisibility Cloak together C that Hermione agreed to make the journey. 

 They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late 
afternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry transforming into a 
balding, middle-aged Muggle man, Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife. The 
beaded bag containing all of their possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which Harry was 
wearing around his neck) was tucked into an inside pocket of Hermiones buttoned-up 
coat. Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak over them, then they turned into the 
suffocating darkness once again. 

 Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were standing hand in 
hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky, in which the nights first stars were already 
glimmering feebly. Cottages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas 
decorations twinkling in their windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of golden 
streetlights indicated the center of the village. 

 All this snow! Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. Why didnt we think of 
snow? After all our precautions, well leave prints! Well just have to get rid of them C 
you go in front, Ill do it C 

 Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse, trying to keep 
themselves concealed while magically covering their traces. 


 Lets take off the Cloak, said Harry, and when she looked frightened, Oh, 
come on, we dont look like us and theres no one around. 

 He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward 
unhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages. Any one of 
them might have been the one in which James and Lily had once lived or where Bathilda 
lived now. Harry gazed at the front doors, their snow-burdened roofs, and their front 
porches, wondering whether he remembered any of them, knowing deep inside that it was 
impossible, that he had been little more than a year old when he had left this place forever. 
He was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at all; he did not know 
what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the little lane along 
which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small square, 
was revealed to them. 

 Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a war memorial 
in the middle, partly obscured by a windblown Christmas tree. There were several shops, 
a post office, a pub, and a little church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel-
bright across the square. 

 The snow here had become impacted: It was hard and slippery where people had 
trodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing in front of them, their figures briefly 
illuminated by streetlamps. They heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub 
door opened and closed; then they heard a carol start up inside the little church. 

 Harry, I think its Christmas Eve! said Hermione. 

 Is it? 

 He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks. 

 Im sure it is, said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. They . . . theyll be in 
there, wont they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it. 

 Harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement, more like fear. Now 
that he was so near, he wondered whether he wanted to see after all. Perhaps Hermione 
knew how he was feeling, because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first 
time, pulling him forward. Halfway across the square, however, she stopped dead. 

 Harry, look! 

 She was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it, it had transformed. 
Instead of an obelisk covered in names, there was a statue of three people: a man with 
untidy hair and glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy 
sitting in his mothers arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy white caps. 

 Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents faces. He had never imagined that 
there would be a statue. . . . How strange it was to see himself represented in stone, a 
happy baby without a scar on his forehead. . . . 

 Cmon, said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and they turned again toward 
the church. As they crossed the road, he glanced over his shoulder; the statue had turned 
back into the war memorial. 

 The singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made Harrys throat 
constrict, it reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions 
of carols from inside suits of armor, of the Great Halls twelve Christmas trees, of 
Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted 
sweater. . . . 


 There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermione pushed it 
open as quietly as possible and they edged through it. On either side of the slippery path 
to the church doors, the snow lay deep and untouched. They moved off through the snow, 
carving deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building, keeping to the 
shadows beneath the brilliant windows. 

 Behind the church, row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket 
of pale blue that was flecked with dazzling red, gold, and green wherever the reflections 
from the stained glass hit the snow. Keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his 
jacket pocket, Harry moved toward the nearest grave. 

 Look at this, its an Abbott, could be some long-lost relation of Hannahs! 

 Keep your voice down, Hermione begged him. 

 They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark tracks into the 
snow behind them, stooping to peer at the words on old headstones, every now and then 
squinting into the surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were 
unaccompanied. 

 Harry, here! 

 Hermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to her, his 
heart positively banging in his chest. 

 Is it C ? 

 No, but look! 

 She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw , upon the frozen, 
lichen-spotted granite, the words Kendra Dumbledore and, a short way down her dates of 
birth and death, and Her Daughter Ariana. There was also a quotation: 

 

 Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 

 

 So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right. The Dumbledore 
family had indeed lived here, and part of it had died here. 

 Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not help thinking 
that he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that Dumbledore 
ought to have told him so, yet he had never thought to share the connection. They could 
have visited the place together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here with 
Dumbledore, of what a bond that would have been, of how much it would have meant to 
him. But it seemed that to Dumbledore, the fact that their families lay side by side in the 
same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he 
wanted Harry to do. 

 Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in 
shadow. He read the words on the tombstone again. Where your treasure is, there will 
your heart be also. He did not understand what these words meant. Surely Dumbledore 
had chosen them, as the eldest member of the family once his mother had died. 

 Are you sure he never mentioned C ? Hermione began. 

 No, said Harry curtly, then, lets keep looking, and he turned away, wishing 
he had not seen the stone: He did not want his excited trepidation tainted with resentment. 

 Here! cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness. Oh 
no, sorry! I thought it said Potter. 


 She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little frown on 
her face. 

 Harry, come back a moment. 

 He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his way back 
through the snow toward her. 

 What? 

 Look at this! 
The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make out the 
name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it. 

 Harry, thats the mark in the book! 

 He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was hard to 
make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath 
the nearly illegible name. 

 Yeah . . . it could be. . . . 

 Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone. 

 It says Ig C Ignotus, I think. . . . 
Im going to keep looking for my parents, all right? Harry told her, a slight edge 
to his voice, and he set off again, leaving her crouched beside the old grave. 

 Every now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott, he had met at 
Hogwarts. Sometimes there were several generations of the same Wizarding family 
represented in the graveyard: Harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out, or 
the current members had moved away from Godrics Hollow. Deeper and deeper 
amongst the graves he went, and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little 
lurch of apprehension and anticipation. 

 The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much deeper. 
Harry looked around, worried, thinking of dementors, then realized that the carols had 
finished, that the chatter and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their 
way back into the square. Somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights. 

 Then Hermiones voice came out of the blackness for the third time, sharp and 
clear from a few yards away. 

 Harry, theyre here . . . right here. 

 And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time: He moved 
toward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest, the same sensation 
he had had right after Dumbledore had died, a grief that had actually weighed on his heart 
and lungs. 

 The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Arianas. It was made of 
white marble, just like Dumbledores tomb, and this made it easy to read, as it seemed to 
shine in the dark. Harry did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make 
out the words engraved upon it. 

 

 JAMES POTTER LILY POTTER 

 

 BORN 27 MARCH 1960 BORN 30 JANUARY 1960 

 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 

 

 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. 

 


 Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance to take in 
their meaning, and he read the last of them aloud. 

 The last enemy that shall be defeated is death . . . A horrible thought came to 
him, and with a kind of panic. Isnt that a Death Eater idea? Why is that there? 

 It doesnt mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry, said 
Hermione, her voice gentle. It means . . . you know . . . living beyond death. Living after 
death. 

 But they were not living, thought Harry. They were gone. The empty words could 
not disguise the fact that his parents moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, 
indifferent, unknowing. And tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then 
instantly freezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending? 
He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, looking down at the thick snow hiding 
from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, 
not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart still beating, alive 
because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was sleeping under 
the snow with them. 

 Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly. He could not look 
at her, but returned the pressure, now taking deep, sharp gulps of the night air, trying to 
steady himself, trying to regain control. He should have brought something o give them, 
and he had not thought of it, and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen. But 
Hermione raised her wand, moved it in a circle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas 
roses blossomed before them. Harry caught it and laid it on his parents grave. 

 As soon as he stood up he wanted to leave: He did not think he could stand 
another moment there. He put his arm around Hermiones shoulders, and she put hers 
around his waist, and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past 
Dumbledores mother and sister, back toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing 
gate. 

 

Chapter Seventeen 

Bathildas Secret 

 

"Harry, stop." 
"What's wrong?" 
They had only just reached the grave of the unknown Abbott. 
"There's someone there. Someone watching us. I can tell. There, over by the bushes." 
They stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing at the dense black boundary of the 
graveyard. Harry could not see anything. 
"Are you sure?" 



"I saw something move. I could have sworn I did..." 
She broke from him to free her wand arm. 
"We look like Muggles," Harry pointed out. 
"Muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave? Harry, I'm sure there's 
someone over there!" 
Harry thought of A History of Magic; the graveyard was supposed to be haunted; what if 
--? But then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to 
which Hermione had pointed. Ghosts could not move snow. 
"It's a cat," said Harry, after a second or two, "or a bird. If it was a Death Eater we'd be 
dead by now. But let's get out of here, and we can put the Cloak back on." 
They glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard. Harry, who 
did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring Hermione, was glad to 
reach the gate and the slippery pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over 
themselves. The pub was fuller than before. Many voices inside it were now singing the 
carol that they had heard as they approached the church. For a moment, Harry considered 
suggesting they take refuge inside it, but before he could say anything Hermione 
murmured, "Let's go this way," and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the 
village in the opposite direction from which they had entered. Harry could make out the 
point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again. They walked 
as quickly as they dared, past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights, the 
outlines of Christmas trees dark through the curtains. 
"How are we going to find Bathilda's house?" asked Hermione, who was shivering a little 
and kept glancing back over her shoulder. "Harry? What do you think? Harry?" 
She tugged at this arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He was looking toward the 
dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next moment he sped up, 
dragging Hermione along with him, she slipped a little on the ice. 
"Harry --" 
"Look ... Look at it, Hermione ..." 
"I don't ... oh!" 
He could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily. The hedge had 
grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay 
scattered amongst the waist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though 
entirely covered in the dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been 
blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where the curse had backfired. He and Hermione 


stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like 
those that flanked it. 
"I wonder why nobody's ever rebuilt it?" whispered Hermione. 
"Maybe you can't rebuild it?" Harry replied. "Maybe it's like the injuries from Dark 
Magic and you can't repair the damage?" 
He slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate, 
not wishing to open it, but simply so he'd some part of the house. 
"You're not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might -- oh, Harry, look!" 
His touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen out of the ground in front 
of them, up thorough the tangles of nettles and weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing 
flower, and in golden letters upon the wood it said: 
On this spot, on this night of 31 October 1981, 
Lily and James Potter lost their lives. 
Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard 
ever to have survived the Killing Curse. 
This house, invisible to Muggles, has been left 
in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters 
and as a reminder of the violence 
that tore apart their family. 
And all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles had been added by other witches 
and wizards who had come to see the place where the Boy Who Lived had escaped. 
Some had merely signed their names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials 
into the wood, still others had left messages. The most recent of these, shining brightly 
over sixteen years' worth of magical graffiti, all said similar things. 
Good luck, Harry, wherever you are. 
If you read this, Harry, we're all behind you! 
Long live Harry Potter. 
"They shouldn't have written on the sign!" said Hermione, indignant. 
But Harry beamed at her. 
"It's brilliant. I'm glad they did. I ..." 
He broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them, silhouetted 
by the bright lights in the distant square. Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that 
the figure was a woman. She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the 
snowy ground. Her stoop, her stoutness, her shuffling gait all gave an impression of 


extreme age. They watched in silence as she drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see 
whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing, but he knew 
instinctively that she would not. At last she came to a halt a few yards from them and 
simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them. 
He did not need Hermione's pinch to his arm. There was next to no chance that this 
woman was a Muggle: She was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been 
completely invisible to her, if she was not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch, 
however, it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old 
ruin. By all the rules of normal magic, meanwhile, she ought not to be able to see 
Hermione and him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that 
they were there, and also who they were. Just as he had reached this uneasy conclusion, 
she raised a gloved hand and beckoned. 
Hermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed against his. 
"How does she know?" 
He shook his head. The woman beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry could think of 
many reasons not to obey the summons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were 
growing stronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the deserted street. 
Was it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long months? That 
Dumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry would come in the end? Was it not likely 
that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to 
this spot? Even her ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledore-ish power that he 
had never encountered before. 
Finally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump. 
"Are you Bathilda?" 
The muffled figure nodded and beckoned again. 
Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Harry raised his eyebrows; 
Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod. 
They stepped toward the woman and , at once, she turned and hobbled off back the way 
they had come. Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate. They followed 
her up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left. 
She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back 
to let them pass. 
She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house; Harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past 
her and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; 
bowed down with age, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind 


them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into 
Harry's face. Her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin, 
and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether 
she could make him out at all; even if she could, it was the balding Muggle whose 
identity he had stolen that she would see. 
The odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as the 
unwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which 
the scalp showed clearly. 
"Bathilda?" Harry repeated. 
She nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the thing inside it 
that sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. 
Did it know, could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near? 
Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though she had not seen her, and 
vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room. 
"Harry, I'm not sure about this," breathed Hermione. 
"Look at the size of her, I think we could overpower her if we had to," said Harry. "Listen, 
I should have told you, I knew she wasn't all there. Muriel called her 'gaga.'" 
"Come!" called Bathilda from the next room. 
Hermione jumped and clutched Harry's arm. 
"It's okay," said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting room. 
Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but it was still very dark, not to 
mention extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched beneath their feet, and Harry's nose 
detected, underneath the dank and mildewed smell, something worse, like meat gone bad. 
He wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda's house to check 
whether she was coping. She seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic, too, for 
she lit the candles clumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching 
fire. 
"Let me do that," offered Harry, and he took the matches from her. She stood watching 
him as he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room, 
perched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and 
moldy cups. 
The last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bow-fronted chest of drawers on 
which there stood a large number of photographs. When the flame danced into life, its 
reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from the 


pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered "Tergeo": The dust 
vanished from the photographs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from 
the largest and most ornate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had 
removed them. Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his 
eye, and he snatched it up. 
It was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who had perched on 
Gregorovitch's windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry out of the silver frame. And it came 
to Harry instantly where he had seen the boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus 
Dumbledore, arm in arm with the teenage Dumbledore, and that must be where all the 
missing photographs were: in Rita's book. 
"Mrs. -- Miss -- Bagshot?" he said, and his voice shook slightly. "Who is this?" 
Bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione light the fire for her. 
"Miss Bagshot?" Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the 
flames burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda looked up at his voice, and the Horcrux 
beat faster upon his chest. 
"Who is this person?" Harry asked her, pushing the picture forward. 
She peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry. 
"Do you know who this is?" he repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual. 
"This man? Do you know him? What's he called?" 
Bathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration. How had Rita Skeeter 
unlocked Bathilda's memories? 
"Who is this man?" he repeated loudly. 
"Harry, what area you doing?" asked Hermione. 
"This picture. Hermione, it's the thief, the thief who stole from Gregorovitch! Please!" he 
said to Bathilda. "Who is this?" 
But she only stared at him. 
"Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs. - Miss -- Bagshot?" asked Hermione, 
raising her own voice. "Was there something you wanted to tell us?" 
Giving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to 
Harry. With a little jerk of her head she looked back into the hall. 
"You want us to leave?" he asked. 


 She repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at him, then at herself, then at the 
ceiling. 
"Oh, right... Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs with her." 
"All right," said Hermione, "let's go." 
But when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor, once more 
pointing first at Harry, then to herself. 
"She wants me to go with her, alone." 
"Why?" asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room, the 
old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise. 
"Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me?" 
"Do you really think she knows who you are?" 
"Yes," said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own. "I think she 
does." 
"Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry." 
"Lead the way," Harry told Bathilda. 
She seemed to understand, because she shuffled around him toward the door. Harry 
glanced back at Hermione with a reassuring smile, but he was not sure she had seen it; 
she stood hugging herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the 
bookcase. As Harry walked out of the room, unseen by both Hermione and Bathilda, he 
slipped the silver-framed photograph of the unknown thief inside his jacket. 
The stairs were steep and narrow; Harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout 
Bathilda's backside to ensure that she did not topple over backward on top of him, which 
seemed only too likely. Slowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper landing, 
turned immediately right, and led him into a low-ceilinged bedroom. 
It was pitch-black and smelled horrible: Harry had just made out a chamber pot 
protruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was 
swallowed by the darkness. 
"Lumos," said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a start: Bathilda had moved close to 
him in those few seconds of darkness, and he had not heard her approach. 
"You are Potter?" she whispered. 


 "Yes, I am." 
She nodded slowly, solemnly. Harry felt the Horcrux beating fast, faster than his own 
heart; It was an unpleasant, agitating sensation. 
"Have you got anything for me?" Harry asked, but she seemed distracted by his lit wand-
tip. 
"Have you got anything for me?" he repeated. 
Then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once: Harry's scar prickled 
painfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved; the dark, 
fetid room dissolved momentarily. He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice: 
Hold him! 
Harry swayed where he stood: The dark, foul-smelling room seemed to close around him 
again; he did not know what had just happened. 
"Have you got anything for me?" he asked for a third time, much louder. 
"Over here," she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his wand and saw the 
outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window. 
This time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and the unmade bed, his wand 
raised. He did not want to look away from her. 
"What is it?" he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what 
looked and smelled like dirty laundry. 
"There," she said, pointing at the shapeless mass. 
And in the instant that he looked away, his eyes taking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, 
a ruby, she moved weirdly: He saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn 
and horror paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring 
from the place where her neck had been. 
The snake struck as he raised his wand: The force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand 
spinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was 
extinguished; Then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of 
him: He fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing -- 
He rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake's tail, which thrashed down upon the 
table where he had been a second earlier. Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him 
as he hit the floor. From below he heard Hermione call, "Harry?" 



He could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: Then a heavy smooth mass 
smashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over him, powerful, muscular -- 
"No!" he gasped, pinned to the floor. 
"Yes," whispered the voice. "Yesss... hold you ... hold you ..." 
"Accio ... Accio Wand ..." 
But nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it 
coiled itself around his torso, squeezing the air from him, pressing the Horcrux hard into 
his chest, a circle of ice that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his 
brain was flooding with cold, white light, all thought obliterated, his own breath drowned, 
distant footsteps, everything going... 
A metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was flying, flying with triumph 
in his heart, without need of broomstick or thestral... 
He was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had released him. He 
scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light: It struck, and 
Hermione dived aside with a shriek; her deflected curse hit the curtained window, which 
shattered. Frozen air filled the room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken 
glass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like something -- his wand -- 
He bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its tail thrashing; 
Hermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst, but then 
there was a loud bang and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking 
Harry hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry 
raised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it 
had done in years. 
"He's coming! Hermione, he's coming!" 
As he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos: It smashed shelves 
from the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and 
seized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione -- 
She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The snake reared again, but 
Harry knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his 
head was going to split open with the pain from his scar -- 
The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, 
Hermione screamed, "Confringo!" and her spell flew around the room, exploding the 
wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt 
the heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, 
he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window 


into nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair ... 
And then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running across the fetid 
bedroom, his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man 
and the little woman twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled 
with the girl's, that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in 
Christmas Day... 
And his scream was Harry's scream, his pain was Harry's pain... that it could happen here, 
where it had happened before... here, within sight of that house where he had come so 
close to knowing what it was to die ... to die ... the pain was so terrible ... ripped from his 
body ... But if he had no body, why did his head hurt so badly; if he was dead, how cold 
he feel so unbearably, didn't pain cease with death, didn't it go ... 
The night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square 
and the shop windows covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry Muggle trappings of a 
world in which they did not believe ... And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose 
and power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions ... Not anger ... 
that was for weaker souls than he ... but triumph, yes ... He had waited for this, he had 
hoped for it ... 
"Nice costume, mister!" 
He saw the small boy's smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the 
cloak, saw the fear cloud his pained face: Then the child turned and ran away ... Beneath 
the robe he fingered the handle of his wand ... One simple movement and the child would 
never reach his mother ... but unnecessary, quite unnecessary ... 
And along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination was in sight at last, 
the Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not know it yet ... And he made less noise 
than the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, 
and steered over it ... 
They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the 
tall black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand 
for the amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. The child was 
laughing and trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small fist ... 
A door opened and the mother entered, saying words he cold not hear, her long dark-red 
hair falling over her face. Now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the 
mother. He threw his wand down upon the sofa and stretched, yawning... 
The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did not hear. His white 
hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door, which burst open... 
He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It was easy, too easy, he 


had not even picked up his wand ... 
"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!" 
Hold him off, without a wand in his hand! ... He laughed before casting the curse ... 
"Avada Kedavra!" 
The green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed against the wall, it 
made the banisters glow like lighting rods, and James Potter fell like a marionette whose 
strings were cut ... 
He could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as long as she was 
sensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear ... He climbed the steps, listening with faint 
amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in ... She had no wand upon her either ... 
How stupid they were, and how trusting, thinking that their safety lay in friends, that 
weapons could be discarded even for moments... 
He forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one 
lazy wave of his wand ... and there she stood, the child in her arms. At the sight of him, 
she dropped her son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would 
help, as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead ... 
"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!" 
"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now." 
"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --" 
"This is my last warning --" 
"Not Harry! Please ... have mercy ... have mercy ... Not Harry! Not Harry! Please -- I'll 
do anything ..." 
"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!" 
He could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more prudent to finish them 
all ... 
The green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her husband. The child had 
not cried all this time. He could stand, clutching the bars of his crib, and he looked up 
into the intruder's face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his 
father who hid beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would pop 
up any moment, laughing -- 
He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy's face: He wanted to see it happen, the 


destruction of this one, inexplicable danger. The child began to cry: It had seen that he 
was not James. He did not like it crying, he had never been able to stomach the small 
ones whining in the orphanage -- 
"Avada Kedavra!" 
And then he broke. He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he must hide himself, 
not here in the rubble of the ruined house, where the child was trapped screaming, but far 
away ... far away ... 
"No," he moaned. 
The snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he had killed the boy, and yet he was 
the boy ... 
"No..." 
And now he stood at the broken window of Bathilda's house, immersed in memories of 
his greatest loss, and at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china and glass... He 
looked down and saw something... something incredible... 
"No..." 
"Harry, it's all right, you're all right!" 
He stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. There he was, the unknown 
thief, the thief he was seeking... 
"No... I dropped it... I dropped it ..." 
"Harry, it's okay, wake up, wake up!" 
He was Harry... Harry, not Voldemort ... and the thing that was rustling was not a snake ... 
He opened his eyes. 
"Harry," Hermione whispered. "Do you feel all -- all right?" 
"Yes," he lied. 
He was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blankets. He could 
tell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and quality of the cold, flat light beyond the 
canvas ceiling. He was drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets and blankets. 
"We got away." 
"Yes," said Hermione. "I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your bunk. I couldn't 


lift you. You've been ... Well, you haven't been quite ..." 
There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her 
hand: She had been wiping his face. 
"You've been ill," she finished. "Quite ill." 
"How long ago did we leave?" 
"Hours ago. It's nearly morning." 
"And I've been... what, unconscious?" 
"Not exactly," said Hermione uncomfortably. "You've been shouting and moaning and ... 
things," she added in a tone that made Harry feel uneasy. What had he done? Screamed 
curses like Voldemort, cried like the baby in the crib? 
"I couldn't get the Horcrux off you," Hermione said, and he knew she wanted to change 
the subject. "It was stuck, stuck to your chest. You've got a mark; I'm sorry, I had to use a 
Severing Charm to get it away. The snake hit you too, but I've cleaned the wound and put 
some dittany on it ..." 
He pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself and looked down. There 
was a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him. He could also see the 
half healed puncture marks to his forearm. 
"Where've you put the Horcrux?" 
"In my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while." 
He lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face. 
"We shouldn't have gone to Godric's Hollow. It's my fault, it's all my fault. Hermione, I'm 
sorry." 
"It's not you fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumbledore might have left the 
sword there for you." 
"Yeah, well ... we got that wrong, didn't we?" 
"What happened, Harry? What happened when she took you upstairs? Was the snake 
hiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attack you?" 
"No." he said. "She was the snake ... or the snake was her ... all along." 
"W-what?" 


 He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda's house on him; it made the whole thing 
horribly vivid. 
"Bathilda must've been dead a while. The snake was ... was inside her. You-Know-Who 
put it there in Godric's Hollow, to wait. You were right. He knew I'd go back." 
"The snake was inside her?" 
He opened his eyes again. Hermione looked revolted, nauseated. 
"Lupin said there would be magic we'd never imagined." Harry said. "She didn't want to 
talk in front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all Parseltongue, and I didn't realize, 
but of course I could understand her. Once we were up in the room, the snake sent a 
message to You-Know-Who, I heard it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he 
said to keep me there ... and then ..." 
He remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda's neck: Hermione did not need to know 
the details. 
"...she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked." 
He looked down at the puncture marks. 
"It wasn't supposed to kill me, just keep me there till You-Know-Who came." 
If he had only managed to kill the snake, it would have been worth it, all of it ... Sick at 
heart, he sat up and threw back the covers. 
"Harry, no, I'm sure you ought to rest!" 
"You're the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you look terrible. I'm fine. I'll keep 
watch for a while. Where's my wand?" 
She did not answer, she merely looked at him. 
"Where's my wand, Hermione?" 
She was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes. 
"Harry ..." 
"Where's my wand?" 
She reached down beside the bed and held it out to him. 



The holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. One fragile strand of phoenix 
feather kept both pieces hanging together. The wood had splintered apart completely. 
Harry took it into his hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible 
injury. He could not think properly: Everything was a blur of panic and fear. Then he 
held out the want to Hermione. 
"Mend it. Please." 
"Harry, I don't think, when it's broken like this --" 
"Please, Hermione, try!" 
"R-Reparo." 
The dangling half of the wand resealed itself. Harry held it up. 
"Lumos!" 
The wand sparked feebly, then went out. Harry pointed it at Hermione. 
"Expelliarmus!" 
Hermione's wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand. The feeble attempt at 
magic was too much for Harry's wand, which split into two again. He stared at it, aghast, 
unable to take in what he was seeing ... the wand that had survived so much ... 
"Harry." Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. "I'm so, so sorry. I 
think it was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I 
cast a Blasting Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must have -- must have hit --" 
"It was an accident." said Harry mechanically. He felt empty, stunned. "We'll -- we'll find 
a way to repair it." 
"Harry, I don't think we're going to be able to," said Hermione, the ears trickling down 
her face. "Remember ... remember Ron? When he broke his wand, crashing the car? It 
was never the same again, he had to get a new one." 
Harry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held hostage by Voldemort; of Gregorovitch, 
who was dead. How was he supposed to find himself a new wand? 
"Well," he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, "well, I'll just borrow yours for now, 
then. While I keep watch." 
Her face glazed with tears, Hermione handed over her wand, and he left her sitting beside 
his bed, desiring nothing more than to get away from her. 

 


Chapter Eighteen 

The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore 

The sun was coming up: The pure, colorless vastness of the sky stretched over 
him, indifferent to him and his suffering. Harry sat down in the tent entrance and took a 
deep breath of clean air. Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy 
hillside ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth, yet he could not appreciate it: 
His senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing his want. He looked out over a 
valley blanketed in snow, distant church bells chiming through the glittering silence. 

Without realizing it, he was digging his fingers into his arms as if he were trying 
to resist physical pain. He had spilled his own blood more times than he could count; he 
had lost all bones in his right arm once; this journey had already given him scars to his 
chest and forearm to join those on his hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, 
had he felt himself to be fatally weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part 
of his magical power had been torn from him. He knew exactly what Hermione would 
say if he expressed any of this: The wand is only as good as the wizard. But she was 
wrong, his case was different. She had not felt the wand spin like the needle of a compass 
and shoot golden flames at his enemy. He had lost the protection of the twin cores, and 
only now that it was gone did he realize how much he had been counting on it. 

He pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and, without looking at 
them, tucked them away in Hagrids pouch around his neck. The pouch was now too full 
of broken and useless objects to take any more. Harrys hand brushed the old Snitch 
through the mokeskin and for a moment he had to fight the temptation to pull it out and 
throw it away. Impenetrable, unhelpful, useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left 
behind --- 

And his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava, scorching him inside, 
wiping out every other feeling. Out of sheer desperation they had talked themselves into 
believing that Godrics Hollow held answers, convinced themselves that they were 
supposed to go back, that it was all part of some secret path laid out for them by 
Dumbledore: but there was no map, no plan. Dumbledore had left them to grope in the 
darkness, to wrestle with unknown and undreamed-of terrors, alone and unaided: Nothing 
was explained, nothing was given freely, they had no sword, and now, Harry had no 
wand. And he had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would surely be easy now 
for Voldemort to find out who he was . . . 

Voldemort had all the information now . . . 

Harry? 

Hermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her own wand. Her face 
streaked with tears, she crouched down beside him, two cups of tea trembling in her 
hands and something bulky under her arm. 

Thanks, he said, taking one of the cups. 

Do you mind if I talk to you? 

No, he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings. 

Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was. Well . . . Ive got 
the book. 

Timidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and Lies of Albus 
Dumbledore. 


Where --- how --- ? 

It was in Bathildas sitting room, just lying there. . . . This note was sticking out 
of the top of it. 

Hermione read the few lines of spiky, acid-green writing aloud. 

 Dear Bally, Thanks for your help. Heres a copy of the book, hope you like it. 
You said everything, even if you dont remember it. Rita. I think it must have arrived 
while the real Bathilda was alive, but perhaps she wasnt in any fit state to read it? 

No, she probably wasnt. 

Harry looked down upon Dumbledores face and experienced a surge of savage 
pleasure: Now he would know if all the things that Dumbledore had never thought it 
worth telling him, whether Dumbledore wanted him to or not. 

Youre still really angry at me, arent you? said Hermione; he looked up to see 
fresh tears leaking out of her eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face. 

No, he said quietly. No, Hermione, I know it was an accident. You were trying 
to get us out of there alive, and you were incredible. Id be dead if you hadnt been there 
to help me. 

He tried to return her watery smile, then turned his attention to the book. Its spine 
was stiff; it had clearly never been opened before. He riffled through the pages, looking 
for photographs. He came across the one he sought almost at once, the young 
Dumbledore and his handsome companion, roaring with laughter at some long-forgotten 
joke. Harry dropped his eyes to the caption. 

 

Albus Dumbledore, shortly after his mothers death, 

With his friend Gellert Grindelwald. 

 

Harry gaped at the last word for several long moments. Grindelwald. His friend 
Grindelwald. He looked sideways at Hermione, who was still contemplating the name as 
though she could not believe her eyes. Slowly she looked up at Harry. 

Grindelwald! 

Ignoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry searched the pages around them 
for a recurrence of that fatal name. He soon discovered it and read greedily, but became 
lost: It was necessary to go farther back to make sense of it all, and eventually he found 
himself at the start of a chapter entitled The Greater Good. Together, he and Hermione 
started to read: 

 

Now approaching his eighteenth birthday, Dumbledore left Hogwarts in a blaze 
of glory --- Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for 
Exceptional Spell-Casting, British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot, 
Gold Medal-Winner for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International 
Alchemical Conference in Cairo. Dumbledore intended, next, to take a Grand 
Tour with Elphias Dogbreath Doge, the dim-witted but devoted sidekick he 
had picked up at school. 

The two young men were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in London, 
preparing to depart for Greece the following morning, when an owl arrived 
bearing news of Dumbledores mothers death. Dogbreath Doge, who refused 
to be interviewed for this book, has given the public his own sentimental 


version of what happened next. He represents Kendras death as a tragic blow, 
and Dumbledores decision to give up his expedition as an act of noble self-
sacrifice. 

Certainly Dumbledore returned to Godrics Hollow at once, supposedly to 
care for his younger brother and sister. But how much care did he actually 
give them? 

He were a head case, that Aberforth, said Enid Smeek, whose family lived 
on the outskirts of Godrics Hollow at that time. Ran wild. Course, with his 
mum and dad gone youd have felt sorry for him, only he kept chucking goat 
dung at my head. I dont think Albus was fussed about him. I never saw them 
together, anyway. 

So what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild young brother? The 
answer, it seems, is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister. For 
though her first jailer had died, there was no change in the pitiful condition of 
Ariana Dumbledore. Her very existence continued to be known only to those 
few outsiders who, like Dogbreath Doge, could be counted upon to believe in 
the story of her ill health. 

Another such easily satisfied friend of the family was Bathilda Bagshot, the 
celebrated magical historian who has lived in Godrics Hollow for many years. 
Kendra, of course, had rebuffed Bathilda when she first attempted to welcome 
the family to the village. Several years later, however, the author sent an owl to 
Albus at Hogwarts, having been favorably impressed by his paper on trans-
species transformation in Transfiguration Today. This initial contract led to 
acquaintance with the entire Dumbledore family. At the time of Kendras death, 
Bathilda was the only person in Godrics Hollow who was on speaking terms 
with Dumbledores mother. 

Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has 
now dimmed. The fires lit, but the cauldrons empty, as Ivor Dillonsby put it 
to me, or, in Enid Smeeks slightly earthier phrase, Shes nutty as squirrel 
poo. Nevertheless, a combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques 
enabled me to extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string together the whole 
scandalous story. 

Like the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts Kendras premature death 
down to a backfiring charm, a story repeated by Albus and Aberforth in later 
years. Bathilda also parrots the family line on Ariana, calling her frail and 
delicate. On one subject, however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I put into 
procuring Veritaserum, for she, and she alone, knows the full story of the best-
kept secret of Albus Dumbledores life. Now revealed for the first time, it calls 
into question everything that his admirers believed of Dumbledore: his 
supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition into the oppression of Muggles, 
even his devotion to his own family. 

The very same summer that Dumbledore went home to Godrics Hollow, 
now an orphan and head of the family, Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into 
her home her great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald. 

The name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most Dangerous Dark 
Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You-


Know-Who arrived, a generation later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never 
extended his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to 
power are not widely known here. 

Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its unfortunate 
tolerance of the Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously 
brilliant as Dumbledore. Rather than channel his abilities into the attainment of 
awards and prizes, however, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself no other 
pursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a 
blind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert Grindelwald, and he was 
expelled. 

Hitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwalds next movements is that he 
traveled around for some months. It can now be revealed that Grindelwald 
chose to visit his great-aunt in Godrics Hollow, and that there, intensely 
shocking though it will be for many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship 
with none other than Albus Dumbledore. 

He seemed a charming boy to me, babbles Bathilda, whatever he became 
later. Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus, who was missing the company 
of lads his own age. The boys took to each other at once. 

They certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her that Albus 
Dumbledore sent Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night. 

Yes, even after theyd spent all day in discussion --- both such brilliant 
young boys, they got on like a cauldron on fire --- Id sometimes hear an owl 
tapping at Gellerts bedroom window, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea 
would have struck him and he had to let Gellert know immediately! 

And what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though Albus Dumbledores 
fans will find it, here are the thoughts of their seventeen-year-old hero, as 
relayed to his new best friend. (A copy of the original letter may be seen on 
page 463.) 

 

Gellert --- 

Your point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGGLES 
OWN GOOD --- this, I think, is the crucial point. Yes, we have been given 
power and yes, that power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us 
responsibilities over the ruled. We must stress this point, it will be the 
foundation stone upon which we build. Where we are opposed, as we 
surely will be, this must be the basis of all our counterarguments. We seize 
control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it follows that where 
we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no 
more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, 
because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.) 

Albus 

 

Astonished and appalled though his many admirers will be, this letter 
constitutes the Statute of Secrecy and establishing Wizard rule over Muggles. 
What a blow for those who have always portrayed Dumbledore as the Muggle-
borns greatest champion! How hollow those speeches promoting Muggle rights 


seem in the light of this damning new evidence! How despicable does Albus 
Dumbledore appear, busy plotting his rise to power when he should have been 
mourning his mother and caring for his sister! 

No doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on his crumbling pedestal 
will bleat that he did not, after all, put his plans into action, that he must have 
suffered a change of heart, that he came to his senses. However, the truth seems 
altogether more shocking. 

Barely two months into their great new friendship, Dumbledore and 
Grindelwald parted, never to see each other again until they met for their 
legendary duel (for more, see chapter 22). What caused this abrupt rupture? Had 
Dumbledore come to his senses? Had he told Grindelwald he wanted no more 
part in his plans? Alas, no. 

It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it, says Bathilda. It came 
as an awful shock. Gellert was there in the house when it happened, and he 
came back to my house all of a dither, told me he wanted to go home the next 
day. Terribly distressed, you know. So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last 
I saw of him. 

Albus was beside himself at Arianas death. It was so dreadful for those two 
brothers. They had lost everybody except for each other. No wonder tempers 
ran a little high. Aberforth blamed Albus, you know, as people will under these 
dreadful circumstances. But Aberforth always talked a little madly, poor boy. 
All the same, breaking Albuss nose at the funeral was not decent. It would have 
destroyed Kendra to see her sons fighting like that, across her daughters body. 
A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the funeral. . . . He would have been 
a comfort to Albus, at least. . . . 

This dreadful coffin-side brawl, known only to those few who attended 
Ariana Dumbledores funeral, raises several questions. Why exactly did 
Aberforth Dumbledore blame Albus for his sisters death? Was it, as Batty 
pretends, a mere effusion of grief? Or could there have been some more 
concrete reason for his fury? Grindelwald, expelled from Durmstrang for the 
near-fatal attacks upon fellow students, fled the country hours after the girls 
death, and Albus (out of shame or fear?) never saw him again, not until forced 
to do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world. 

Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to have referred to this 
brief boyhood friendship in later life. However, there can be no doubt that 
Dumbledore delayed, for some five years of turmoil, fatalities, and 
disappearances, his attack upon Gellert Grindelwald. Was it lingering affection 
for the man or fear of exposure as his once best friend that caused Dumbledore 
to hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set out to capture the man 
he was once so delighted he had met? 

And how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the inadvertent victim of 
some Dark rite? Did she stumble across something she ought not to have done, 
as the two young men sat practicing for their attempt at glory and domination? 
Is it possible that Ariana Dumbledore was the first person to die for the greater 
good? 

 


The chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had reached the bottom 
of the page before him. She tugged the book out of Harrys hands, looking a little 
alarmed by his expression, and closed it without looking at it, as though hiding something 
indecent. 

Harry --- 

But he shook his head. Some inner certainty had crashed down inside him; it was 
exactly as he had felt after Ron left. He had trusted Dumbledore, believed him the 
embodiment of goodness and wisdom. All was ashes: How much more could he lose? 
Ron, Dumbledore, the phoenix wand . . . 

Harry. She seemed to have heard his thoughts. "Listen to me. It --- it doesn't 
make a very nice reading ---" 

"Yeah, you could say that ---" 

"--- but don't forget, Harry, this is Rita Skeeter writing." 

"You did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn't you?" 

"Yes, I --- I did." She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea in her cold hands. 
"I think that's the worst bit. I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but 'For the 
Greater Good' became Grindelwald's slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he 
committed later. And . . . from that . . . it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea. They 
say 'For the Greater Good' was even carved over the entrance to Nurmengard." 

"What's Nurmengard?" 

"The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. He ended up in there 
himself, once Dumbledore had caught him. Anyway, it's --- its an awful thought that 
Dumbledore's ideas helped Grindelwald rise to power. But on the other hand, even Rita 
can't pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one summer when 
they were both really young, and ---" 

"I thought you'd say that," said Harry. He did not want to let his anger spill out at 
her, but it was hard to keep his voice steady. "I thought you'd say 'They were young.' 
They were the same age as we are now. And here we are, risking our lives to fight the 
Dark Arts, and there he was, in a huddle with his new best friend, plotting their rise to 
power over the Muggles." 

His temper would not remain in check much longer: He stood up and walked 
around, trying to work some of it off. 

"I'm not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote," said Hermione. "All that 'right 
to rule' rubbish, it's 'Magic Is Might' all over again. But Harry, his mother had just died, 
he was stuck alone in the house ---" 

"Alone? He wasn't alone! He had his brother and sister for company, his Squib 
sister he was keeping locked up ---" 

"I don't believe it," said Hermione. She stood up too. "Whatever was wrong with that 
girl, I don't think she was a Squib. The Dumbledore we knew would never, ever have 
allowed---" 

"The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn't want to conquer Muggles by force!" 
Harry shouted, his voice echoing across the empty hilltop, and several blackbirds rose 
into the air, squawking and spiraling against the pearly sky. 

"He changed, Harry, he changed! It's as simple as that! Maybe he did believe 
these things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to 
fighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore was the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who 


always voted for Muggle protection and Muggle born rights, who fought You-Know-
Who from the start, and who died trying to bring him down!" 

Rita's book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of Albus 
Dumbledore smiled dolefully at both. 

"Harry, I'm sorry, but I think the real reason you're so angry is that Dumbledore 
never told you any of this himself." 

"Maybe I am!" Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms over his head, hardly 
knowing whether he was trying to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight of 
his own disillusionment. "Look what he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! 
And again! And again! And don't expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, 
trust that I know what I'm doing, trust me even though I don't trust you! Never the whole 
truth! Never!" 

His voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each other in the 
whiteness and emptiness, and Harry felt they were as insignificant as insects beneath that 
wide sky. 

"He loved you," Hermione whispered. "I know he loved you." 

Harry dropped his arms. 

"I don't know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn't love, the 
mess he's left me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with 
Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me." 

Harry picked up Hermione's wand, which he had dropped in the snow, and sat 
back down in the entrance of the tent. 

"Thanks for the tea. I'll finish the watch. You get back in the warm." 

She hesitated, but recognized the dismissal. She picked up the book and then walked 
back past him into the tent, but as she did so, she brushed the top of his head lightly with 
her hand. He closed his eyes at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what she 
said was true: that Dumbledore had really cared. 

 

Chapter Nineteen 

The Silver Doe 

 

 It was snowing by the time Hermione took over the watch at midnight. Harry's 
dreams were confused and disturbing: Nagini wove in and out of them, first through a 
wreath of Christmas roses. He woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that somebody had 
called out to him in the distance, imagining that the wind whipping around the tent was 
footsteps or voices. 

 Finally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled in the 
entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand. The snow was 
falling thickly, and she greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving 
on. 

 "We'll somewhere more sheltered," she agreed, shivering as she pulled on a 
sweatshirt over her pajamas. "I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside. I even 
though I saw somebody one or twice." 


 Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent, 
motionless Sneakoscope on the table. 

 "I'm sure I imagined it," said Hermione, looking nervous. "The snow the dark, it 
plays tricks on your eyes.... But perhaps we ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility 
Cloak, just in case?" 

 Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux, and 
Hermione clutching the beaded bag, they Disapparated. The usual tightness engulfed 
them; Harry's feet parted company with the snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what 
felt like frozen earth covered in leaves. 

 "Where are we?" he asked, peering around at the fresh mass of trees as Hermione 
opened the beaded bag and began tugging out the tent poles. 

 "The Forest of Dean," she said, "I came camping here once with my mum and 
dad." 

 Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but they were at 
least protected from the wind. They spent most of the day inside the tent, huddled for 
warmth around the useful bright blue flames that Hermione was adept at producing, and 
which could be scooped up and carried in a jar. Harry felt as though he was recuperating 
from some brief but severe, an impression reinforced by Hermione's solicitousness. That 
afternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon them, so that even their sheltered clearing had a 
fresh dusting of powdery snow. 

 After two nights of little sleep, Harry's senses seemed more alert than usual. 
Their escape from Godric's Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed somehow 
closer than before, more threatening. As darkness drove in again Harry refused 
Hermione's offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed. 

 Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the 
sweaters he owned but even so, still shivery. The darkness deepened with the passing 
hours until it was virtually impenetrable. He was on the point of taking out the 
Marauder's Map, so as to watch Ginny's dot for a while, before he remembered that it was 
the Christmas holidays and that she would be back at the Burrow. 

 Every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest. Harry knew 
that it must be full of living creatures, but he wished they would all remain still and silent 
so that he could separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might 
proclaim other, sinister movements. He remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over 
dead leaves many years ago, and at once thought he heard it again before mentally 
shaking himself. Their protective enchantments had worked for weeks; why should they 
break now? And yet he could no throw off the feeling that something was different 
tonight. 

 Several times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had fallen asleep, 
slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent. The night reached such a depth 
of velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparation 
and Apparation. He had just held a hand in front of his face to see whether he could 
make out his fingers when it happened. 

 A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees. 
Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed simply to drift toward 
him. 


 He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione's wand. 
He screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees in front of it pitch black in 
silhouette, and still the thing came closer.... 

 And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak. It was a silver 
white doe, moon-bright and dazzling, picking her way over the ground, still silent, and 
leaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering of snow. She stepped toward him, her 
beautiful head with its wide, long-lashed eyes held high. 

 Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her strangeness, but her 
inexplicable familiarity. He felt that he had been waiting for her to come, but that he had 
forgotten, until this moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impulse to shout for 
Hermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone. He knew, he would have 
staked his life on it, that she had come for him, and him alone. 

 They gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and 
walked away. 

 "No," he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. "Come back!" 

 She continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon he brightness was 
striped by their thick black trunks. For one trembling second he hesitated. Caution 
murmured it could be a trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him 
that this was not Dark Magic. He set off in pursuit. 

 Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed through 
the trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the forest she led him, 
and Harry walked quickly, sure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach 
her properly. And then she would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to 
know. 

 At last she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head toward him once more, 
and he broke into a run, a question burning in him, but as he opened his lips to ask it, she 
vanished. 

 Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was still 
imprinted on his retinas; it obscured his vision, brightening when he lowered his eyelids, 
disorienting him. Now fear came: Her presence had meant safety. 

 "Lumos!" he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited. 

 The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there, 
listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. 
Was he about to be attacked? Had she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining 
that somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight, watching him? 

 He held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of green light burst 
from behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him to this spot? 

 Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun about, but all that 
was there was a small, frozen pool, its black, cracked surface glittering as he raised his 
wand higher to examine it. 

 He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected his 
distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick, misty gray 
carapace, something else glinted. A great silver cross... 

 His heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at the pool's edge and 
angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. A 


glint of deep red...It was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt....The sword of 
Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool. 

 Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible? How could it 
have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping? 
Had some unknown magic drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had 
taken to be a Patronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been put 
into the pool after they had arrived, precisely because they were here? In which case, 
where was the person who wanted to pass it to Harry? Again he directed the wand at the 
surrounding trees and bushes, searching for a human outline, for the glint of an eye, but 
he could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear leavened his exhilaration 
as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool. 

 He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, "Accio Sword." 

 It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy the sword would 
have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off 
around the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to 
him. He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help. 

 "Help," he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom, indifferent, 
motionless. 

 What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had told him 
the last time he had retrieved the sword? Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that 
out of the hat. And what were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice 
inside Harry's head answered him: Their daring nerve and chivalry set Gryffindor apart. 

 Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath dispersing 
rapidly upon the frozen air. He knew what he had to do. If he was honest with himself, 
he had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through 
the ice. 

 He glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now that 
nobody was going to attack him. They had had their chance as he walked alone through 
the forest, had had plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to 
delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting. 

 With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. 
Where "chivalry" entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it 
counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead. 

 An owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought with a pang of 
Hedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he continued to 
strip off until at last he stood there in his underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed 
the pouch containing his wand, his mother's letter, the shard of Sirius's mirror, and the old 
Snitch on top of his clothes, then he pointed Hermione's wand at the ice. 

 "Diffindo." 

 It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence. The surface of the pool broke 
and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water. As far as Harry could judge, it was 
not deep, but to retrieve the sword he would have to submerge himself completely. 

 Contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water warmer. He 
stepped to the pool's edge and placed Hermione's wand on the ground still lit. Then, 
trying not to imagine how much colder he was about to become or how violently he 
would soon be shivering, he jumped. 


 Every pore of his body screamed in protest. The very air in his lungs seemed to 
freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water. He could hardly 
breathe: trembling so violently the water lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the 
blade with his numb feet. He only wanted to dive once. 

 Harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second, gasping and 
shaking, until he told himself that it must be done, gathered all his courage, and dived. 

 The cold was agony: It attacked him like fire. His brain itself seemed to have 
frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out, groping for the 
sword. His fingers closed around the hilt; he pulled it upward. 

 Then something closed tight around his neck. He thought of water weeds, though 
nothing had brushed him as he dived, and raised his hand to free himself. It was not 
weed: The chain of the Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe. 

 Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the surface, but merely 
propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at 
the strangling chain, his frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were 
popping inside his head, and he was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he 
could do, and the arms that closed around his chest were surely Death's.... 

 Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life, he 
came to facedown in the snow. Somewhere, close by, another person was panting and 
coughing and staggering around, as she had come when the snake attacked....Yet it did 
not sound like her, not with those deep coughs, no judging by the weight of the 
footsteps.... 

 Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior's identity. All he could do 
was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly 
into his flesh. It was gone. Someone had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from 
over his head. 

 "Are -- you -- mental?" 

 Nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given Harry the strength to 
get up. Shivering violently, he staggered to his feet. There before him stood Ron, fully 
dressed but drenched to the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor in 
one hand and the Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other. 

 "Why the hell," panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which swung backward and 
forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, "didn't you take the thing off 
before you dived?" 

 Harry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing compared with 
Ron's reappearance; he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he caught up the pile 
of clothes still lying at the water's edge and began to pull them on. As he dragged 
sweater after sweater over his head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to have 
disappeared every time he lost sight of him, and yet he had to be real: He had just dived 
into the pool, he had saved Harry's life. 

 "It was y-you?" Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice weaker than usual 
due to his near-strangulation. 

 "Well, yeah," said Ron, looking slightly confused. 

 "Y-you cast that doe?" 

 "What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!" 

 "My Patronus is a stag." 


 "Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers." 

 Harry put Hagrid's pouch back around his neck, pulled on a final sweater, stooped 
to pick up Hermione's wand, and faced Ron again. 

 "How come you're here?" 

 Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all. 

 "Well, I've -- you know -- I've come back. If --" He cleared his throat. "You 
know. You still want me." 

 There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron's departure seemed to rise like a 
wall between them. Yet he was here. He had returned. He had just saved Harry's life. 

 Ron looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised to see the 
things he was holding. 

 "Oh yeah, I got it out," he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up the sword for 
Harry's inspection. "That's why you jumped in, right?" 

 "Yeah," said Harry. "But I don't understand. How did you get here? How did 
you find us?" 

 "Long story," said Ron. "I've been looking for you for hours, it's a big forest, isn't 
it? And I was just thinking I'd have to go kip under a tree and wait for morning when I 
saw that dear coming and you following." 

 "You didn't see anyone else?" 

 "No," said Ron. "I --" 

 But he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together some yards away. 

 "I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the 
time, because you'd gone in and you hadn't come up, so I wasn't going to make a detour 
to -- hey!" 

 Harry was already hurrying to the place that Ron had indicated. The two oaks 
grew close together; there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level, 
an ideal place to see but not be seen. The ground around the roots, however, was free of 
snow, and Harry could see no sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron stood 
waiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux. 

 "Anything there?" Ron asked. 

 "No," said Harry. 

 "So how did the sword get in that pool?" 

 "Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there." 

 They both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glinting a little in the 
light from Hermione's wand. 

 "You reckon this is the real one?" asked Ron. 

 "One way to find out, isn't there?" said Harry. 

 The Horcrux was still swinging from Ron's hand. The locket was twitching 
slightly. Harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated again. It had sensed the 
presence of the sword and had tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was 
not the time for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy once and for all. Harry 
looked around, holding Hermione's wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in 
the shadow of a sycamore tree. 

 "Come here." he said and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock's surface, 
and held out his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered the sword, however, Harry 
shook his head. 


 "No you should do it." 

 "Me?" said Ron, looking shocked. "Why?" 

 "Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it's supposed to be you." 

 He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe 
was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at 
least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of 
certain acts. 

 "I'm going to open it," said Harry, "and you will stab it. Straightaway okay? 
Because whatever's in there will put up a fight. The bit of Riddle in the Diary tried to kill 
me." 

 "How are you going to open it?" asked Ron. He looked terrified 

 "I'm going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue," said Harry. The answer came so 
readily to his lips that thought that he had always known it deep down: Perhaps it had 
taken his recent encounter with Nagini to make him realize it. He looked at the 
serpentine S, inlaid with glittering green stones: It was easy to visualize it as a miniscule 
snake, curled upon the cold rock. 

 "No!" said Ron. "Don't open it! I'm serious!" 

 "Why not?" asked Harry. "Let's get rid of the damn thing, it's been months --" 

 "I can't, Harry, I'm serious -- you do it --" 

 "But why?" 

 "Because that thing's bad for me!" said Ron, backing away from the locket on the 
rock. "I can't handle it! I'm not making excuses, for what I was like, but it affects me 
worse than it affects you and Hermione, it made me think stuff -- stuff that I was thinking 
anyway, but it made everything worse. I can't explain it, and then I'd take it off and I'd 
get my head straight again, and then I'd have to put the effing thing back on -- I can't do it 
Harry!" 

 He had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking his head. 

 "You can do it," said Harry, "you can! You've just got the sword, I know it's 
supposed to be you who uses it. Please just get rid of it Ron." 

 The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swallowed, then still 
breathing hard through his long nose, moved back toward the rock. 

 "Tell me when," he croaked. 

 "On three," said Harry, looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes, 
concentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled 
like a trapped cockroach. It would have been easy to pity it, except that the cut around 
Harry's neck still burned. 

 "One . . . two . . . three . . .open." 

 The last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung 
wide open with a little click. 

 Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome 
as Tom Riddle's eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit-pupiled 

 "Stab," said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock. 

 Ron raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point dangled over the frantically 
swiveling eyes, and Harry gripped the locket tightly, bracing himself, already imagining 
blood pouring from the empty windows. 

 Then a voice hissed from out the Horcrux. 


 "I have seen your heart, and it is mine." 

 "Don't listen to it!" Harry said harshly. "Stab it!" 

 "I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears. All you 
desire is possible, but all that you dread is also possible...." 

 "Stab!" shouted Harry, his voice echoed off the surrounding trees, the sword point 
trembled, and Ron gazed down into Riddle's eyes. 

 "Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter . . . Least loved, now, 
by the girl who prefers your friend . . . Second best, always, eternally overshadowed . . ." 

"Ron, stab it now!" Harry bellowed: He could feel the locket quivering in the grip and 
was scared of what was coming. Ron raised the sword still higher, and as he did so, 
Riddle's eyes gleamed scarlet. 

 
Out of the locket's two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed like two grotesque 
bubbles, the heads of Harry and Hermione, weirdly distorted. 

 

Ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket, first 
chests, then waists, then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side like trees with a 
common root, swaying over Ron and the real Harry, who had snatched his fingers away 
from the locket as it burned, suddenly, white-hot. 

 

"Ron!" he shouted, but the Riddle-Harry was now speaking with Voldemort's voice and 
Ron was gazing, mesmerized, into its face. 

 

"Why return? We were better without you, happier without you, glad of your absence.... 
We laughed at your stupidity, your cowardice, your presumption--" 

 

"Presumption!" echoed the Riddle-Hermione, who was more beautiful and yet more 
terrible than the real Hermione: She swayed, cackling, before Ron, who looked horrified, 
yet transfixed, the sword hanging pointlessly at his side. "Who could look at you, who 
would ever look at you, beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, compared with 
the Chosen One? What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?" 

 

"Ron, stab it, STAB IT!" Harry yelled, but Ron did not move. His eyes were wide, and 
the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione were reflected in them, their hair swirling like 
flames, their eyes shining red, their voices lifted in an evil duet. 

 

"Your mother confessed," sneered Riddle-Harry, while Riddle-Hermione jeered, "that she 
would have preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange..." 

 

"Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, 
nothing to him," crooned Riddle-Hermione, and she stretched like a snake and entwined 
herself around Riddle-Harry, wrapping him in a close embrace: Their lips met. 

 
On the ground in front of them, Ron's face filled with anguish. he raised the sword high, 
his arms shaking. 


 "Do it, Ron!" Harry yelled. 

 
Ron looked toward him, and Harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes. 

 
"Ron --?" 

 

The sword flashed, plunged: Harry threw himself out of the way, there as a clang of metal 
and a long, drawn-out scream. Harry whirled around, slipping in the snow, wand held 
ready to defend himself, but there was nothing to fight. 

 

The monstrous versions of himself and Hermione were gone: There was only Ron, 
standing there with the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at the shattered 
remains of the locket on the flat rock. 

 

Slowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say or do. Ron was breathing 
heavily: His eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue: they were also wet. 

 
Harry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the broken Horcrux. Ron had 
pierced the glass in both windows: Riddle's eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of 
the locket was smoking slightly. The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished; 
torturing Ron had been its final act. The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to 
his knees, his head in his arms. He was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold. Harry 
crammed the broken locket into his pocket, knelt down beside Ron, and placed a hand 
cautiously on his shoulder. He took it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off. 

 

"After you left," he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron's face was hidden, 
"she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn't want me to see. There were loads 
of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone..." 

 

He could not finish; it was now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how 
much his absence had cost them. 

 

"She's like my sister," he went on. "I love her like a sister and I reckon that she feels the 
same way about me. It's always been like that. I thought you knew." 

 

Ron did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and wiped his nose noisily on 
his sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and walked to where Ron's enormous rucksack lay 
yards away, discarded as Ron had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. He 
hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry 
approached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed. 

 

"I'm sorry," he said in a thick voice. "I'm sorry I left. I know I was a -- a --" 

 

He looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad enough word would swoop down 
upon him and claim him. 


 

"You've sort of made up for it tonight," said Harry. "Getting the sword. Finishing off the 
Horcrux. Saving my life." 

 

"That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was," Ron mumbled. 

 

"Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was" said Harry. "I've been trying to 
tell you that for years." 

 

Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the still-sopping back 
of Ron's jacket. 

 

"And now," said Harry as they broke apart, "all we've got to do is find that tent again." 

 

But it was not difficult. Though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed 
lengthy, with Ron by his side, the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. 
Harry could not wait to wake Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that he 
entered the tent, Ron lagging a little behind him. 

 

It was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only illumination the bluebell 
flames still shimmering in a bowl on the floor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under 
her blankets, and did not move until Harry had said her name several times. 

 

"Hermione!" 

 

She stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face. 

 
"What's wrong? Harry? Are you all right?" 

 

"It's okay, everything's fine. More than fine, I'm great. There's someone here." 

 

"What do you mean? Who --?" 

 

She saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet. 
Harry backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron's rucksack, and attempted to blend 
in with the canvas. 

 

Hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward Ron, her eyes upon 
his pale face. She stopped right in front of him, her lips slightly parted, her eyes wide. 
Ron gave a weak hopeful smile and half raised his arms. 

 

Hermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him that she could 
reach. 

 

"Ouch -- ow -- gerroff! What the --? Hermione -- OW!" 

 


"You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!" 

 

She punctuated every word with a blow: Ron backed away, shielding his head as 
Hermione advanced. 

 

"You -- crawl -- back -- here -- after -- weeks -- and -- weeks -- oh, where's my wand?" 

 

She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry's hands and he reacted instinctively. 

 

"Protego!" 

 

The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione. The force of it knocked her 
backward onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she lept up again. 

 
"Hermione!" said Harry. "Calm --" 

 

"I will not calm down!" she screamed. Never before had he seen her lose control like this; 
she looked quite demented. "Give me back my wand! Give it back to me!" 

 

"Hermione, will you please --" 

 

"Don't you tell me what do, Harry Potter!" she screeched. "Don't you dare! Give it back 
now! And YOU!" 

 

She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation: It was like a malediction, and Harry could not 
blame Ron for retreating several steps. 

 

"I cam running after you! I called you! I begged you to come back" 
"I know," Ron said, "Hermione, I'm sorry, I'm really --" 

 

"Oh, you're sorry!" 

 

She laughed a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked at Harry for help, but 
Harry merely grimaced his helplessness. 

 

"You came back after weeks -- weeks -- and you think it's all going to be all right if you 
just say sorry?" 

 

"Well, what else can I say?" Ron shouted, and Harry was glad that Ron was fighting back. 

 

"Oh, I don't know!" yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. "Rack your brains, Ron, that 
should only take a couple of seconds --" 

 

"Hermione," interjected Harry, who considered this a low blow, "he just saved my --" 

 


"I don't care!" she screamed. "I don't care what he's done! Weeks and weeks, we could 
have been dead for all he knew --" 

 

"I knew you weren't dead!" bellowed Ron, drowning her voice for the first time, and 
approaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm between them. "Harry's all over 
the Prophet, all over the radio, they're looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and 
mental stories, I knew I'd hear straight off if you were dead, you don't know what it's 
been like --" 

 

"What it's been like for you?? 

 

Her voice was not so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon, but she had reached a 
level of indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless, and Ron seized his 
opportunity. 

 

"I wanted to come back the minute I'd Disapparated, but I walked straight into a gang of 
Snatchers, Hermione, and I couldn't go anywhere!" 
"A gang of what?" asked Harry, as Hermione threw herself down into a chair with her 
arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would unravel them for 
several years. 

 

"Snatchers," said Ron. "They're everywhere -- gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up 
Muggle-borns and blood traitors, there's a reward from the Ministry for everyone 
captured. I was on my own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited, 
thought I was a Muggle-born in hiding. I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to 
the Ministry." 

 

"What did you say to them?" 
"Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of." 
"And they believed that?" 
"They weren't the brightest. One of them was definitely part troll, the smell of him...." 

 

Ron glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might soften at this small instance of 
humor, but her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs. 

 

"Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit pathetic to be 
honest, but there were still five of them and only one of me, and they'd taken my wand. 
Then two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit 
the one holding me in the stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, 
and Disapparated. I didn't do it so well. Splinched myself again" -- Ron held up his right 
hand to show two missing fingernails: Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly -- "and I 


came out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank 
where we'd been ... you were gone." 

 

"Gosh, what a gripping story," Hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when 
wishing to wound. "You must have been simply terrified. Meanwhile we went to Godric's 
Hollow and, let's think, what happened there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know-Who's snake 
turned up, it nearly killed both of us, and then You-Know-Who himself arrived and 
missed us by about a second." 
"What?" Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione ignored him. 

 
"Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our sufferings into perspective, 
doesn't it?" 
"Hermione," said Harry quietly, "Ron just saved my life." 

 

She appeared not to have heard him. 

 
"One thing I would like to know, though," she said, fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over 
Ron's head. "How exactly did you find us tonight? That's important. Once we know, we'll 
be able to make sure we're not visited by anyone else we don't want to see." 

 

Ron glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket. 

 
"This." 

 

She had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them. 

 

"The Deluminator?" she asked, so surprised she forgot to look cold and fierce. 

 

"It doesn't just turn the lights on and off," said Ron. "I don't know how it works or why it 
happened then and not any other time, because I've been wanting to come back ever since 
I left. But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard ... I 
heard you." 

 

He was looking at Hermione. 

 

"You heard me on the radio?" she asked incredulously. 

 

"No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice," he held up the Deluminator 
again, "came out of this." 

 

"And what exactly did I say?" asked Hermione, her tone somewhere between skepticism 
and curiosity. 

 

"My name. 'Ron.' And you said ... something about a wand...." 


 

Hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered: it had been the first time 
Won's name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left; Hermione 
had mentioned it when talking about repairing Harry's wand. 

 

"So I took it out," Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, "and it didn't seem different 
or anything, but I was sure I'd heard you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my 
room, but another light appeared right outside the window." 

 

Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes focused on something 
neither Harry nor Hermione could see. 

 

"It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get around a Portkey, 
you know?" 

 

"Yeah," said Harry and Hermione together automatically. 

 

"I knew this was it," said Ron. "I grabbed my stuff and packed it, then I put on my 
rucksack and went out into the garden. 

 

"The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I came out it 
bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it ... well, it went inside 
me." 

 

"Sorry?" said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly. 

 

"It sort of floated toward me," said Ron, illustrating the movement with his free index 
finger, "right to my chest, and then -- it just went straight through. It was here," he 
touched a point close to his heard, "I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me, I 
knew what I was supposed to do. I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I 
Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill. There was snow everywhere...." 

 

"We were there," said Harry. "We spent two nights there, and the second night I kept 
thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!" 
"Yeah, well, that would've been me," said Ron. "Your protective spells work, anyway, 
because I couldn't see you and I couldn't hear you. I was sure you were around, though, 
so in the end I got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought 
you'd have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent." 

 

"No, actually," said Hermione. "We've been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as 
an extra precaution. And we left really early, because as Harry says, we'd heard 
somebody blundering around." 

 

"Well, I stayed on that hill all day," said Ron. "I kept hoping you'd appear. But when it 
started to get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the 


blue light came out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these 
woods. I still couldn't see you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in 
the end -- and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously." 

 

"You saw the what?" said Hermione sharply. 

 

They explained what had happened and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the 
pool unfolded, Hermione frowned form one to the other of them, concentrating so hard 
she forgot to keep her limbs locked together. 

 
"But it must have been a Patronus!" she said. "Couldn't you see who was casting it? 
Didn't you see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can't believe this! Then what 
happened?" 

 

Ron explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool, and had waited for him to 
resurface; how he had realized that something was wrong, dived in, and saved Harry, 
then returned for the sword. He got as far as the opening of the locket, then hesitated, and 
Harry cut in. 

 

"-- and Ron stabbed it with the sword." 

 

"And ... and it went? Just like that?" she whispered. 

 

"Well, it -- it screamed," said Harry with half a glance at Ron. "Here." 

 

He threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured 
windows. 

 

Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield Charm with a wave of 
Hermione's wand and turned to Ron. 

 
"Did you just say now that you got away from the snatchers with a spare wand?" 

 

"What?" said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining the locket. "Oh -- oh 
yeah." 

 

He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short dark wand out of his pocket. 
"Here, I figured it's always handy to have a backup." 

 

"You were right," said Harry, holding out his hand. "Mine's broken." 

 

"You're kidding?" Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her feet, and he looked 
apprehensive again. 

 

Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed back into her 
bed and settled down without another word. 


 

Ron passed Harry the new wand. 

 

"About the best you could hope for, I think," murmured Harry. 

 

"Yeah," said Ron. "Could've been worse. Remember those birds she set on me?" 

 

"I still haven't ruled it out," came Hermione's muffled voice from beneath her blankets, 
but Harry saw Ron smiling slightly as he pulled his maroon pajamas out of his rucksack. 

 

 

Chapter Twenty 

Xenophilius Lovegood 

 

Harry had not expected Hermione's anger to abate over night and was 
therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and 
pointed silences the next morning. Ron responded by maintaining an 
unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing 
remorse. In fact, when all three of them were together Harry felt like the 
only non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral. During those few moments he 
spent alone with Harry, however (collecting water and searching the 
undergrowth for mushrooms). Ron became shamelessly cheery. 
"Someone helped us," he kept saying, "Someone sent that doe, Someone's on 
our side, One Horcrux down, mate!" 
Bolstered by the destruction of the locket they set to debating the possible 
locations of the other Horcruxes and even though they had discussed the 
matter so often before. Harry felt optimistic, certain that more 
breakthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione's sulkiness could not mar 
his buoyant spirits; The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of 
the mysterious due, the recovery of Gryffindors sword, and above all, Ron's 
return made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a 
straight face. 
Late in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione's baleful presence again 
and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent 
blackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange of news. Harry had 
finally managed to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione's various 
wanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric's 
Hollow; Ron was now filling Harry in on everything he had discovered about 
the wider Wizarding world during his weeks away. 



"... and how did you find out about the Taboo?" he asked Harry after 
explaining the many desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the 
Ministry." 
"The what?" 
"You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who's name!" 
"Oh, yeah, Well, it's just a bad habit we've slipped into," said Harry. "But 
I haven't got a problem calling him V ---" 
"NO!" roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose 
buried in a book at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. "Sorry," said 
Ron, wrenching Harry back out of the brambles, "but the name's been jinxed, 
Harry, that's how they track people! Using his name breaks protective 
enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance --- it's how they 
found us in Tottenham Court Road!" 
"Because we used his *name*?" 
"Exactly! You've got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was only people 
who were serious about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who even dared 
use it. Now they've put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is trackable --- 
quick-and-easy way to find Order members! They nearly got Kingsley ---" 
"You're kidding?" 
"Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said but he fought his way 
out. He's on the run now just like us." Ron scratched his chin 
thoughtfully with 
the end of his wand. "You don't reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?" 
"His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?" 
"Oh yeah..." 
They moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione. 
"Harry... you don't reckon it could've been Dumbledore?" 
"Dumbledore what?" 
Ron looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, "Dumbledore ... the 
doe? I mean," Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, "he had 
the real sword last, didn't he? 



Harry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing 
behind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to 
them, that he was watching over them, would have inexpressibly comforting. 
He shook his head. 
"Dumbledores dead," he said. "I saw it happen, I saw the body. He's 
definitely gone. Anyway his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe" 
"Patronuses can change, though can't they?" said Ron, "Tonkss changed 
didn't it?" 
Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn't he show himself? Why 
wouldn't he just hand us the sword? 
"Search me," said Ron. "Same reason he didn't give it to you while he was 
alive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kid's 
stories?" 
"Which is what?" asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face desperate 
for the answer. 
"I dunno," said Ron. "Sometimes I've thought, when I've been a bit hacked 
off, he was having a laugh or --- or he just wanted to make it more 
difficult, But I don't think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing when 
he gave me the Deluminator, didn't he? He -- well," Ron's ears turned bright 
red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded 
with his toe, "he must've known I'd run out on you." 
"No," Harry corrected him. "He must've known you'd always want to come 
back." 
Ron looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to change the subject, Harry 
said, "Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him?" 
"Oh yeah," said Ron at once, "people are talking about it quite a lot. 
'Course, if things were different it'd be huge news, Dumbledore being pals 
with Grindelwald, but now it's just something to laugh about for people who 
didn't like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who 
thought he was such a good bloke. I don't know that it's such a big deal, 
though. He was really young when they --" 
"Our age," said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in 
his face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the subject. 
A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry 
took aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous night, which 


Hermione had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of 
blackthorn. 
"*Engorgio*" 
"The spider gave a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry tried 
again. This time the spider grew slightly larger. 
"Stop that," said Ron sharply, " I'm sorry I said Dumbledore was young, 
okay?" 
Harry had forgotten Ron's hatred of spiders. 
"Sorry --- *Reducio*" 
The spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every 
minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful 
than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt 
intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else's hand sewn to the end of 
his arm. 
"You just need to practice," said Hermione, who had approached them 
noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to 
enlarge and reduce the spider. "Its all a matter of confidence Harry." 
He knew why she wanted it to be all right; She still felt guilty about 
breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprung to his lips, that she 
could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he 
would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he 
agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and 
vanished behind her book once more. 
All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took 
first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand 
levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and 
less powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk 
reading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small 
wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try to tune it. 
"There's this one program," he told Harry in a low voice, "that tells the 
news like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who's side and are 
following the Ministry line, but this one ... you wait till you hear it, it's 
great. Only they can't do it every night, they have to keep changing 
locations in case they're raided and you need a password to tune in ... 
Trouble is, I missed the last one..." 



He drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand muttering random 
words under his breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly 
fearing an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of him he might 
not have been there. For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione 
turned the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice with the 
blackthorn wand. 
Finally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at once. 
"If it's annoying you, I'll stop!" he told Hermione nervously. 
Hermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry. 
"We need to talk," she said. 
He looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was * The Life and Lies 
of Albus Dumbledore.* 
"What?" he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was a 
chapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita's 
version of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione's answer however, was 
completely unexpected. 
"I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood." 
He stared at her. 
"Sorry?" 

 

Xenophilius Lovegood, Lunas father. I want to go and talk to him! 

er C why? 

She took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, Its that mark, the 
mark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this! 

She thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harrys unwilling eyes 
and saw a photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, 
with Dumbledores familiar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof 
that Dumbledore really had written those words, that they had not been Ritas invention. 

The signature, said Hermione. Look at the signature, Harry! 

He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking 
more closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of 
Albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle 
the Bard. 

Er C what are you -- ? said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a 
look and turned back to Harry. 

It keeps cropping up, doesnt it? she said. I know Viktor said it was 
Grindelwalds mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godrics Hollow, and the 


dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, 
we cant ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means C I dont even know whether 
Grindelwalds still alive C but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at 
the wedding. Im sure this is important, Harry! 

Harry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face and 
then out into the surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause he said, Hermione, 
we dont need another Godrics Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and C 

 But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle the Bard, 
how do you know were not supposed to find out about the sign? 

 Here we go again! Harry felt slightly exasperated. We keep trying to convince 
ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues C 

 The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful, piped up Ron. I think 
Hermiones right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. 

 Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Rons support of Hermione 
had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune. 

 It wont be like Godrics Hollow, Ron added, Lovegoods on your side, Harry, 
The Quibblers been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone theyve got to help you! 

 Im sure this is important! said Hermione earnestly. 

 But dont you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he 
died? 

 Maybe . . . maybe its something you need to find out for yourself, said 
Hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws. 

 Yeah, said Ron sycophantically, that makes sense. 

 No, it doesnt, snapped Hermione, but I still think we ought to talk to Mr. 
Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godrics Hollow? Harry, 
Im sure we ought to know about this! 

 I think we should vote on it, said Ron. Those in favor of going to see Love 
good C 

 His hand flew into the air before Hermiones. Her lips quivered suspiciously as 
she raised her own. 

 Outvoted, Harry, sorry, said Ron, clapping him on the back. 

 Fine, said Harry, half amused, half irritated. Only, once weve seen Lovegood, 
lets try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegoods live, 
anyway? Do either of you know? 

 Yeah, theyre not far from my place, said Ron. I dunno exactly where, but 
Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them. Shouldnt be 
hard to find. 

 When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice. 

 You only agreed to try and get back in her good books. 

 Alls fair in love and war, said Ron brightly, and this is a bit of both. Cheer up, 
its the Christmas holidays, Lunall be home! 

 They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchopole from the 
breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage point 
the village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight 
stretching to earth in the breaks between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking 
toward the Burrow, their hands shadowing their eyes, but all they could make out were 


the high hedges and trees of the orchard, which afforded the crooked little house 
protection from Muggle eyes. 

 Its weird, being this near, but not going to visit, said Ron. 

 Well, its not like you havent just seen them. You were there for Christmas, 
said Hermione coldly. 

 I wasnt at the Burrow! said Ron with an incredulous laugh. Do you think I 
was going to go back there and tell them all Id walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and 
George wouldve been great about it. And Ginny, shed have been really understanding. 

 But where have you been, then? asked Hermione, surprised. 

 Bill and Fleurs new place. Shell cottage. Bills always been decent to me. He C 
he wasnt impressed when he heard what Id done, but he didnt go on about it. He knew 
I was really sorry. None of the rest of the family know I was there. Bill told Mum he and 
Fleur werent going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone. You 
know, first holiday after they were married. I dont think Fleur minded. You know how 
much she hates Celestina Warbeck. 

 Ron turned his back on the Burrow. 

 Lets try up here, he said, leading the way over the top of the hill. 

 They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermiones insistence, hidden beneath the 
Invisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one 
small cottage, which seemed deserted. 

 Do you think its theirs, and theyve gone away for Christmas? said Hermione, 
peering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. 
Ron snorted. 

 Listen, Ive got a feeling youd be able to tell who lived there if you looked 
through the Lovegoods window. Lets try the next lot of hills. 

 So they Disapparated a few miles farther north. 

 Aha! shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes. Ron was 
pointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most 
strange-looking house rose vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a 
ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky. Thats got to be Lunas house, 
who else would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook! 

 Its nothing like a bird, said Hermione, frowning at the tower. 

 I was talking about a chess rook, said Ron. A castle to you. 

 Rons legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first. When Harry 
and Hermione caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in their sides, they 
found him grinning broadly. 

 Its theirs, said Ron. Look. 

 Three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broke-down gate. The first read, 

 THE QUIBBLER. EDITOR, X. LOVEGOOD 

 

the second, 

 PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE 

 

the third, 

 KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS 

 


 The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front door 
was overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in orange 
radishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognized a 
Snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent 
with the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red fruits and bushy 
crowns of white beaded mistletoe, stood sentinel on either side of the front door. A little 
owl with a slightly flattened hawklike head peered down at them from one of the 
branches. 

 Youd better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry, said Hermione. Its you Mr. 
Lovegood wants to help, not us. 

 He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag. She 
then rapped three times on the thick black door, which was studded with iron nails and 
bore a knocker shaped like an eagle. 

Barely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood 
Xenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained 
nightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius 
had been positively dapper at Bill and Fleur's wedding by comparison. 
"What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?" he cried in a 
high-pitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and 
finally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect, comical O. 
"Hello, Mr. Lovegood," said Harry, holding out his hand, "I'm Harry, 
Harry Potter." 
Xenophilius did not take Harry's hand, although the eye that was not 
pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry's forehead. 
"Would it be okay if we came in?" asked Harry. "There's something we'd 
like to ask you." 
"I . . . I'm not sure that's advisable," whispered Xenophilius, He 
swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. "Rather a shock . . . My 
word . . . I . . . I'm afraid I don't really think I ought to ---" 
"It wont take long" said Harry, slightly disappointed by this 
less-than-warm welcome. 
"I --- oh, all right then. Come in, quickly, Quickly!" 
They were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door 
shut behind them, They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had 
ever seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that he felt like being 
inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls - the 
stove, the sink, and the cupboards - and all of it had been painted with 
flowers, insects, and birds in bright primary colors. Harry thought he 
recognized Luna's styles. The effect in such and enclosed space, was 
slightly overwhelming. 
In the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase ld to the 
upper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from 
overhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing. 
"You'd better come up." said Xenophilius, still looking extremely 
uncomfortable, and he led the way. 
The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, 


and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller 
and entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on 
the unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic 
labyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon 
piles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of 
creatures Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung 
from the ceiling. 
Luna was not there: The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden 
object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels, It looked like the 
bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of shelves, but after a moment 
Harry deduced that it was an old-fashioned printing press, due to the fact 
that it was churning out Quibblers. 
"Excuse me," said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized 
grubbily tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers, 
which all tumbled onto the floor, and threw it over the press, somewhat 
muffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry. 
"Why have you come here?" 
Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small cry of shock. 
"Mr. Lovegood - what's that?" 
See was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a 
unicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into 
the room. 
"It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack," said Xenophilius. 
"No it isn't!" said Hermione. 
"Hermione," muttered Harry, embarrassed, "now's not the moment -" 
"But Harry, it's an Erumpent horn! It's a Class B Tradeable Material and 
it's an extraordinary dangerous thing to have in a house!" 
"How'd you know it's an Erumpent horn?" asked Ron, edging away from the 
horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room. 
"There's a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. 
Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don't you know it can 
explode at the slightest touch?" 
"The Crumple Horned Snorkack" said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish 
look upon his face, is a shy and highly magical creature, and it's horn -" 
"Mr. Lovegood. I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that's 
an Erumpent horn and it's incredibly dangerous - I don't know where you got 
it-" 
"I bought it," said Xenophilius dogmatically. "Two weeks ago, from a 
delightful young wizard who knew my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A 
Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now," he said, turning to Harry, "why 
exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?" 
"We need some help," said Harry, before Hermione could start again. 
"Ah," said Xenophilius, "Help, Hmm." 
His good eye moved again to Harry's scar. He seemed simultaneously 
terrified and mesmerized. 
"Yes. The thing is ... helping Harry Potter ... rather dangerous..." 


 "Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to 
help Harry?" said Ron. "In that magazine of yours?" 
Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still 
banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth. 
"Er - yes, I have expressed that view. however -" 
"That's for everyone else to do, not you personally?" said Ron. 
Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between 
the three of them. Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some 
painful internal struggle. 
"Where's Luna?" asked Hermione. "Let's see what she thinks." 
Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he said in 
a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, "Luna 
is down at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She...she will like 
to see you. I'll go and call her and then - yes, very well. I shall try to 
help you." 
He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front open 
and close. They looked at each other. 
"Cowardly old wart," said Ron. "Luna's got ten times his guts." 
"He's probably worried about what'll happen to them if the Death Eaters 
find out I was here" said Harry. 
"Well, I agree with Ron, " said Hermione, "Awful old hypocrite, telling 
everyone else to help you and trying to worm our of it himself. And for 
heaven's sake keep away from that horn." 
Harry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He could see a 
stream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the 
hill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the window as he stared 
in the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. 
Ginny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other today than 
they had been since Bill and Fleur's wedding, but she could have no idea he 
was gazing toward her now, thinking of her. He suppose he ought to be glad 
of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, Xenophilius's attitude 
proved that. 
he turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another peculiar 
object standing upon the cluttered, curved slide board; a stone but of a 
beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking 
headdress. Two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out from 
the sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue wing was stuck to a leather strap 
that ran over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been 
stuck to a second strap around her forehead. 
"Look at this," said Harry. 
"Fetching," said Ron. "Surprised he didn't hear that to the wedding." 
They heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius climbed 
back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encase in 
Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming 
teapot. 
"Ah, you have spotted my pet invention," he said, shoving the tray into 


Hermione's arms and joining Harry at the statue's side. 
"Modeled, fittingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful Rowens Ravenclaw, 
'Wit beyond measure is a man's greatest treasure!'" 
He indicated the objects like ear trumpets. 
"These are the Wrackpurt siphons - to remove all sources of distraction 
from the thinker's immediate area. Here, "he pointed out the tiny wings, "a 
billywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind. Finally, "he 
pointed to the orange radish, "the dirigible Plum, so as to enhance the 
ability to accept the extraordinary." 
Xenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had managed to 
balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables. 
"May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?" said Xenophilius. "We 
make it ourselves." As he started to pour out the drink, which was as deeply 
purple as beetroot juice, he added, "Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge, she 
is most excited that you are here She ought not to be too long, she has 
caught nearly enough Plumpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and 
help yourselves to sugar. 
"Now," he remove a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat 
down, his Wellingtoned legs crossed, "how may I help you, Mr. Potter?" 
"Well," said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly, 
"it's about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at Bill and 
Fleur's wedding, Mr. Lovegood. We wondered what it meant." 
Xenophilius raised his eyebrows. 
"Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?" 

 

 

 

Chapter Twenty-One 

The Tale of the Three Brothers 

 

Harry turned to look at Ron and Hermione. Neither of them seemed to have 
understood what Xenophilius had said either. 

"The Deathly Hallows?" 

"That's right," said Xenophilius. "You haven't heard of them? I'm not surprised. 
Very, very few wizards believe. Witness that knuckle-headed young man at your 
brother's wedding," he nodded at Ron, "who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a 
well-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the Hallows C at 
least not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other 
believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest." 

He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank some. 

"I'm sorry," said Harry, "I still don't really understand." 

To be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged: The stuff was 
quite disgusting, as though someone had liquidized bogey-flavored Every Flavor Beans. 


"Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows," said Xenophilius, smacking 
his lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion. 

"But what are the Deathly Hallows?" asked Hermione. 

Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup. 

"I assume that you are familiar with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers'?" 

Harry said, "No," but Ron and Hermione both said, "Yes." Xenophilius nodded 
gravely. 

"Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with 'The Tale of the Three 
Brothers' . . . I have a copy somewhere . . ." 

He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and books, but 
Hermione said, "I've got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I've got it right here." 

And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag. 

"The original?" inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nodded, he said, 
"Well then, why don't you read it out aloud? Much the best way to make sure we all 
understand." 

"Er. . . all right," said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and Harry saw 
that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little 
cough, and began to read. 

"'There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road 
at twilight C'" 

"Midnight, our mum always told us," said Ron, who had stretched out, arms 
behind his head, to listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance. 

"Sorry, I just think it's a bit spookier if it's midnight!" said Ron. 

"Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives," said Harry before he 
could stop himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was 
staring out of the window at the sky. "Go on, Hermione." 

"In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too 
dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and 
so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous 
water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded 
figure. 

"'And Death spoke to them C'" 

"Sorry," interjected Harry, "but Death spoke to them?" 

"It's a fairy tale, Harry!" 

"Right, sorry. Go on." 

"'And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of the 
three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He 
pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had 
earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him. 

"'So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more 
powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand 
worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the 
banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the 
oldest brother. 

"'Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to 
humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So 


Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told 
him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead. 

"'And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The 
youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not 
trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place 
without being followed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own 
Cloak of Invisibility.'" 

"Death's got an Invisibility Cloak?" Harry interrupted again. 

"So he can sneak up on people," said Ron. "Sometimes he gets bored of running at 
them, flapping his arms and shrieking . . . sorry, Hermione." 

"'Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, 
and they did so talking with wonder of the adventure they had had and admiring Death's 
gifts. 

"'In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination. 

"'The first brother traveled on for a week more, and reaching a distant village, 
sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand 
as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead 
upon the floor the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the 
powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible. 

"'That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-
sodden upon his bed. The thief took the wand and for good measure, slit the oldest 
brother's throat. 

"'And so Death took the first brother for his own. 

"'Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. 
Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in 
his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to 
marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him. 

"'Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had 
returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the 
second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as to truly join her. 

"'And so Death took the second brother from his own. 

"'But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never 
able to find him. It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother 
finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And the he greeted Death 
as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.'" 

Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to 
realize that she had stopped reading; then he withdrew his gaze from the window and 
said: "Well, there you are." 

"Sorry?" said Hermione, sounding confused. 

"Those are the Deathly Hallows," said Xenophilius. 

He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of 
parchment from between more books. 

"The Elder Wand," he said, and drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment. 
"The Resurrection Stone," he said, and added a circle on top of the line. "The Cloak of 
Invisibility," he finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbols 
that so intrigued Hermione. "Together," he said, "the Deathly Hallows." 


"But there's no mention of the words 'Deathly Hallows' in the story," said 
Hermione. 

"Well, of course not," said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. "That is a children's 
tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters, 
however, recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if 
united, will make the possessor master of Death." 

There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. 
Already the sun was low in the sky. 

"Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon," he said quietly. 

"When you say 'master of Death' C"said Ron. 

"Master," said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. "Conqueror. Vanquisher. 
Whichever term you prefer." 

"But then . . . do you mean . . ." said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that 
she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, "that you believe these 
objects C these Hallows C really exist?" 

Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again. 

"Well, of course." 

"But," said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, "Mr. 
Lovegood, how can you possibly believe C ?" 

"Luna has told me all about you, young lady," said Xenophilius. "You are, I 
gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded." 

"Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione," said Ron, nodding toward the 
ludicrous headdress. His voice shook with the strain of not laughing. 

"Mr. Lovegood," Hermione began again, "We all know that there are such things 
as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But C" 

"Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to 
say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a 
Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but 
fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly 
renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and 
impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have 
you ever seen like that, Miss Granger?" 

Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more 
confused than ever. She, Harry and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that they 
were all thinking the same thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one 
Xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment. 

"Exactly," said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument. 
"None of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, 
would he not?" 

He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the faintest 
trace of pink. 

"All right," said Hermione, disconcerted. "Say the Cloak existed. . . what about 
that stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?" 

"What of it?" 

"Well, how can that be real?" 

"Prove that is not," said Xenophilius. 


Hermione looked outraged. 

"But that's C I'm sorry, but that's completely ridiculous! How can I possibly prove 
it doesn't exist? Do you expect me to get hold of C of all the pebbles in the world and test 
them? I mean, you could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is 
that nobody's proved it doesn't exist!" 

"Yes, you could," said Xenophilius. "I am glad to see that you are opening your 
mind a little." 

"So the Elder Wand," said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, "you 
think that exists too?" 

"Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence," said Xenophilius. "The Elder 
Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from 
hand to hand." 

"Which is what?" asked Harry. 

"Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, 
if he is to be truly master of it," said Xenophilius. "Surely you have heard of the way the 
wand came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how 
Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the 
dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from Baraabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The 
bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history." 

Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not 
contradict him. 

"So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?" asked Ron. 

"Alas, who knows?" said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. "Who 
knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. 
Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who 
can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us." 

There was a pause. Finally Hermione asked stiffly, "Mr. Lovegood, does the 
Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?" 

Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry's memory, but he 
could not locate it. Peverell. . . he had heard that name before. . . 

"But you have been misleading me, young woman!" said Xenophilius, now sitting 
up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. "I thought you were new to the 
Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything C 
everything! C to do with the Hallows!" 

"Who are the Peverells?" asked Ron. 

"That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric's Hollow," said 
Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. "Ignotus Peverell." 

"Exactly!" said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically. "The sign of the 
Death Hallows on Ignotus's grave is conclusive proof!" 

"Of what?" asked Ron. 

"Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers, 
Antioch, Cadmus and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!" 

With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and 
headed for the spiral staircase. 

"You will stay for dinner?" he called, as he vanished downstairs again. 
"Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimply soup." 


"Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo's," said Ron under his 
breath. 

Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen 
downstairs before speaking. 

"What do you think?" he asked Hermione. 

"Oh, Harry," she said wearily, "it's a pile of utter rubbish. This can't be what the 
sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time." 

"I s'pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks," said Ron. 

"You didn't believe it either?" Harry asked him. 

"Nah, that story's just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn't 
it? 'Don't go looking for trouble, don't go pick fights, don't go messing around with stuff 
that's best left alone! Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you'll be 
okay. Come to think of it," Ron added, "maybe that story's why elder wands are supposed 
to be unlucky." 

"What are you talking about?" 

"One of those superstitions, isn't it? 'May-born witches will marry Muggles.' 'Jinx 
by twilight, undone by midnight.' 'Wand of cider, never prosper.' You must have heard 
them. My mum's full of them." 

"Harry and I were raised by Muggles," Hermione reminded him. "We were taught 
different superstitions." She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the 
kitchen. The one good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed 
to have made her forget that she was annoyed at Ron. "I think you're right," she told him. 
"It's just a morality tale, it's obvious which gift is best, which one you'd choose C" 

The three of them spoke at the same time: Hermione said, "the Cloak," Ron said, 
"the wand," and Harry said, "the stone." 

They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused. 

"You're supposed to say the Cloak," Ron told Hermione, "but you wouldn't need 
to be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!" 

 
"We've already got an Invisibility Cloak," said Harry, "And it's helped us rather a lot, in 
case you hadn't noticed!" said Hermione. "Whereas the wand would be bound to attract 
trouble--" 
"Only if you shouted about it," argued Ron. "Only if you were prat enough to go dancing 
around waving it over your head, and singing, 'I've got an unbeatable want, come and 
have a go if you think you're hard enough.' As long as you kept your trap shut --" 
-Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?" said Hermione, looking skeptical. "You know 
the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful 
wands for hundreds of years." 
"There have?" asked Harry. 
Hermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and 
Ron grinned at each other. 
"The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the 
centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard whos boasting about them. 
Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but -- oh it's all nonsense. Wands are only as 
powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are 
bigger and better than other people's" 


"But how do you know," said Harry, "that those wants -- the Deathstick, and the Wand of 
Destiny -- aren't the same want, surfacing over the centuries under different names?" 
"What if they're all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?" said Ron. 
Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was after all, ridiculous. His 
wand, he reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by 
Ollivander, whatever it had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies 
and if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken? 
"So why would you take the stone?" Ron asked him. 
"Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius...Mad-
Eye...Dumbledore...my parents..." 
Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled. 
"But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn't want to come back, would they?" said 
Harry, thinking about the tail they had just heard. "I don't suppose there have been loads 
of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?: he asked Hermione. 
"No," she replied sadly. "I don't think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves 
that's possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer's Stone; you know, 
instead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death." 
The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger. It was something like burning 
underpants. Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever 
Xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings. 
"What about the Cloak, though?" said Ron slowly. "Don't you realize, he's right? I've got 
so used to Harry's Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I've never heard of 
one like Harry's. It's infallible. We've never been spotted under it --" 
"Of course not -- we're invisible when we're under it, Ron!" 
"But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they're not exactly ten a Knut, you know, 
is true! It's never occurred to me before but I've heard stuff about charms wearing off 
cloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they've got holes, 
Harry's was owned by his dad, so it's not exactly new, is it, but it's just ... perfect!" 
"Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone..." 
As they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching 
the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. 
His own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. After a 
moment's bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he 
began to clime the stairs. 
"Harry, what are you doing? I don't think you should look around when he's not here!" 
But Harry had already reached the next level. Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling 
with five beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They 
were not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about 
them all the same. Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be a fine golden chains 
wove around the pictures linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or 
so, Harry realized that the chains were actually one work repeated a thousand times in 
golden ink: friends... friends... friends... 
Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a 
large photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. 
They were hugging. Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had 
ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared 


around. Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with dust. There were 
no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look, 
as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest 
window across the blood red sky. 
"What's wrong?" Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could 
respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray 
laden with bowls. 
"Mr. Lovegood," said Harry. "Where's Luna?" 
"Excuse me?" 
"Where's Luna?" 
Xenophilius halted on the top step. 
"I -- I've already told you. She is down at the Botions Bridge fishing for Plimpies." 
"So why have you only laid that tray for four?" 
Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued 
chugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius's hands 
shook. 
"I don't think Luna's been here for weeks." said Harry. "Her clothes are gone, her bed 
hasn't been slept in. Where is she? and why do you keep looking out of the window?" 
Xenophilius dropped the tray. The bowls bounced and smashed Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione drew their wands. Xenophilius froze his hand about to enter his pocket. At that 
moment the printing press have a huge bank and numerous Quibblers came streaming 
across the floor from underneath the tablecloth, the press fell silent at last. Hermione 
stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. 
Lovegood. 
"Harry, look at this" He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter. 
The front of the Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words 
"Undesirable Number One" and captioned with the reward money. 
"The Quibbler's going for a new angle, then?: Harry asked coldly, his mind working very 
fast. "Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? 
Sending an owl to the Ministry? 
Xenophilius licked his lips 
"They took my Luna," he whispered, "Because of what I've been writing. They took my 
Luna and I don't know where she is, what they've done to her. But they might give her 
back to me if I -- If I--" 
"Hand over Harry?" Hermione finished for him. 
"No deal." said Ron flatly. "Get out of the way, we're leaving." 
Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer. 
"They will be here any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not 
leave." 
He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother 
doing the same thing in front of his crib. 
"Don't make us hurt you," Harry said. "Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood." 
"HARRY!" Hermione screamed. 
Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away 
from him. Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time. He 
launched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm's way as 


Xenophilius's Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn. 
There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart. 
Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, along with an 
impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to the 
floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard 
Hermione's scream, Ron's yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him 
that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs. 
Half buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself. He could barely breathe or see for dust. 
Half of the ceiling had fall in and the end of Luna's bead was hanging through the hole. 
The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing fragments of 
torn parchment were floating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side, 
blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another white shape moved close by, 
and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed his finger to her lips. 
The door downstairs crashed open. 
"Didn't I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?" said a rough voice. "Didn't I tell 
you this nutter was just raving as usual?" There was a bang and a scream of pain from 
Xenophilius. 
"No...no...upstairs...Potter!" 
"I told you last week Lovegood, we weren't coming back for anything less than some 
solid information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for 
that stupid bleeding headdress? And the week before" -- Another bang, another squeal -- 
"When you thought we'd give her back if you offered us proof there are Cumple" -- Bang 
-- "Headed"--bang--"Snorkacks?" 
"No -- no -- I beg of you!" sobbed Xenophilius. "It really is Potter, Really!" 
"And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!" roared the Death 
Eater, and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from 
Xenophilius. 
"The place looks like it's about to fall in, Selwyn," said a cool second voice, echoing up 
the mangled staircase. "The stairs are completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might 
bring the place down." 
"You lying piece of filth." shouted the wizard named Selwyn. 
"You have never seen Potter in your life, have you? Thought you'd lure us here to kill us, 
did you? And you think you'll get your girl back like this?" 
"I swear...I swear...Potter's upstairs!" 
"Homenum revelio." said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp, 
and he had the odd sensation something was swooping low over him, immersing his body 
in its shadow. 
"There's someone up there all right, Selwyn," said the second man sharply. 
"It's Potter, I tell you, it's Potter!" sobbed Xenophilius. "Please...please...give me Luna, 
just let me have Luna..." 
"You can have your little girl, Lovegood," said Selwyn, "if you get up those stairs and 
bring me down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it's a trick, if you've got an accomplice 
waiting up there to ambush us, we'll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to 
bury." 
Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings. 
Xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs. 


"Come on," Harry whispered, "we've got to get out of here." 
He started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the 
staircase. Ron was buried the deepest. Harry and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they 
could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off 
his legs. While Xenophilius banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, Hermione 
managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm. 
"All right." breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs 
begin to tremble. Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. 
"Do you trust me Harry?" 
Harry nodded. 
"Okay then." Hermione whispered. "give me the invisibility Cloak. Ron, you're going to 
put it on." 
"Me? But Harry --" 
"Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron grab my shoulder." 
Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking 
the stairs was vibrating. Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry 
did not know what Hermione was waiting for. 
"Hold tight" she whispered. "Hold tight...any second..." 
Xenophilius's paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard. 
"Obliviate!" cried Hermione, pointing her want first into his face then at the floor beneath 
them. "Deprimo!" 
She had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders. Harry still 
holding onto her hand for dear life, there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two 
men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained 
all around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in midair and thundering of 
the collapsing house rang in Harry's ears as she dragged him once more into darkness. 

 

Chapter Twenty-Two 

The Deathly Hallows 

 

 Harry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at once. They seemed to have 
landed in the corner of a field at dusk; Hermione was already running in a circle around 
them, waving her wand. 

 Protego TotalumSalvio Hexia 

 That treacherous old bleeder. Ron panted, emerging from beneath the 
Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. Hermione youre a genius, a total genius. I 
cant believe we got out of that. 

 Cave InimicumDidnt I say it was an Frumpent horn, didnt I tell him? And 
now his house has been blown apart! 

 Serves him right, said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs, 
Whatd you reckon theyll do to him? 

 Oh I hope they dont kill him! groaned Hermione, Thats why I wanted the 
Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadnt 
been lying! 


 Why hide me though? asked Ron. 

 Youre supposed to be in bed with spattergrolt, Ron! Theyve kidnapped Luna 
because her father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew 
youre with him? 

 But what about your mum and dad? 

 Theyre in Australia, said Hermione, They should be all right. They dont 
know anything. 

Youre a genius, Ron repeated, looking awed. 

Yeah, you are, Hermione, agreed Harry fervently. I dont know what wed do 
without you. 

She beamed, but became solemn at once. 

What about Luna? 

Well, if theyre telling the truth and shes still Alive --- began Ron. 

Dont say that, dont say it! squealed Hermione. She must be alive, she must! 

Then shell be in Azkaban, I expect, said Ron. Whether she survives the place, 
thoughLoads dont 

She will, said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. Shes 
tough, Luna, much tougher than youd think. Shes probably teaching all the inmates 
about Wrackspurts and Nargles. 

I hope youre right, said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes. Id feel 
so sorry for Xenophilius if --- 

---if he hadnt just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah, said Ron. 

They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. After their 
narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home: safe, familiar, and friendly. 

Oh, why did we go there? groaned Hermione after a few minutes silence. 
Harry, you were right, it was Godrics Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time! 
The Deathly Hallowssuch rubbishalthough actually, a sudden thought seemed to 
have struck her, he might have made it all up, mightnt he? He probably doesnt believe 
in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters 
arrived! 

I dont think so, said Ron. Its a damn sight harder making stuff up when 
youre under stress than youd think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It 
was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a 
whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we 
stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us 
talking. 

Well, I dont suppose it matters, sighed Hermione. Even if he was being 
honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life. 

Hang on, though, said Ron. The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a 
myth, wasnt it? 

But the Deathly Hallows cant exist, Ron! 

You keep saying that, but one of them can, said Ron. Harrys Invisibility 
Cloak --- 

The Tale of the Three Brothers is a story, said Hermione firmly. A story about 
how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the 
Invisibility Cloak, wed have everything we need already! 


I dont know. We could do with an unbeatable wand, said Harry, turning the 
blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers. 

Theres no such thing, Harry! 

You said there have been loads of wands --- the Deathstick and whatever they 
were called --- 

All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wands real, what about the 
Resurrection Stone? Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her 
tone dripped sarcasm. No magic can raise the dead, and thats that! 

When my wand connected with You-Know-Whos, it made my mum and dad 
appearand Cedric 

But they werent really back from the dead, were they? said Hermione. Those 
kind of ---of pale imitations arent the same as truly bringing someone back to life. 

But she, the girl in the tale, didnt really come back, did she? The story says that 
once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see 
her and talk to her, didnt he? He even lived with her for a while 

He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermiones expression. 
Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear: He had scared her with his 
talk of living with dead people. 

So that Peverell bloke whos buried in Godrics Hollow, he said hastily, trying 
to sound robustly sane, you dont know anything about him, then? 

No, she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. I looked him up 
after I saw the mark on his grave; if hed been anyone famous or done anything important, 
Im sure hed be in one of our books. The only place Ive managed to find the name 
Peverell Is Natures Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher, 
she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. It lists the pure-blood families that are now 
extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to 
vanish. 

Extinct in the male line? repeated Ron. 

It means the name died out, said Hermione, centuries ago, in the case of the 
Peverells. They could still have descendents, though, theyd just be called something 
different. 

And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the 
sound of the name Peverell: a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a 
Ministry official, and he cried aloud, Marvolo Gaunt! 

Sorry said Ron and Hermione together. 

Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Whos grandfather! In the Pensieve! With 
Dumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells! 

Ron and Hermione looked bewildered. 

The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the 
Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministrys face, he 
nearly shoved it up his nose! 

The Peverell coat of arms? said Hermione sharply. Could you see what it 
looked like? 

Not really, said Harry, trying to remember. There was nothing fancy on there, 
as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had 
been cracked open. 


Harry saw Hermiones comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes. Ron 
was looking from one to the other, astonished. 

BlimeyYou reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Hallows? 

Why not said Harry excitedly, Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived 
like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through 
the centuries, he might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that 
house, and trust me, he wasnt the type to read fairy tales to his kids. Hed have loved to 
think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, 
having pure blood made you practically royal. 

Yesand thats all very interesting, said Hermione cautiously, but Harry, if 
youre thinking what I think youre think --- 

Well, why not? Why not? said Harry, abandoning caution. It was a stone, 
wasnt it? He looked at Ron for support. What if it was the Resurrection Stone? 

Rons mouth fell open. 

Blimey --- but would it still work if Dumbledore broke --- ? 

Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! Theres no such thing as a Resurrection 
Stone! 

Hermione leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. Harry youre trying to 
fit everything into the Hallows story --- 

Fit everything in? he repeated. Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the 
sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the 
Peverells! 

A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly! 

Whered you reckon the ring is now? Ron asked Harry. What did Dumbledore 
do with it after he broke it open? 

But Harrys imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermiones 

Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of 
DeathMasterConquerorVanquisherThe last enemy that shall be destroyed is 
death 

And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose 
Horcruxes were no matchNeither can live while the other survivesWas this the 
answer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a way after all, to ensure that he was the 
one who triumphed? If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe? 

Harry? 

But he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was 
running it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen 
anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was 
exactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer 
completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable 
concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it 

And then, with a gasp, he remembered 

Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died! 

His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care. 

My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He 
wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is 
buried in Godrics Hollow Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as 


though great new vistas of truth were opening all around him. Hes my ancestor. Im 
descended from the third brother! It all makes sense! 

He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of 
possessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the 
other two. 

Harry, said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his 
neck, his fingers shaking hard. 

Read it, he told her, pushing his mothers letter into her hand. Read it! 
Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didnt need a 
Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself 
completely invisible without one! 

Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He had dislodged 
the Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly 
tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder 
erupted inside him so that he shouted out. 

ITS IN HERE! He left me the ring C its in the Snitch! 

You --- you reckon? 

He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear 
to Harry. Everything fit, everythingHis Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he 
discovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to 
do was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then --- 

But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope 
and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness, and the 
glorious spell was broken. 

Thats what hes after. 

The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared. 

You-Know-Whos after the Elder Wand. 

He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. 
It all made sense, Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a 
very old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and 
Hermione as he looked out into the night, thinking 

Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him 
The Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. 
Hardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew 
about them? 

Harry gazed into the darknessIf Voldemort had known about the Deathly 
Hallows, surely he would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects 
that made the possessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he 
might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didnt the simple fact that he had 
taken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last 
great Wizarding secret? 

Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full 
power, without understanding that it was one of threefor the wand was the Hallow that 
could not be hidden, whose existence was best knownThe bloody trail of the Elder 
Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history 


Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the 
face of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries. 

He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing 
exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lilys letter, Ron at her side 
looking slightly anxious. Didnt they realize how far they had traveled in the last few 
minutes? 

This is it? Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own 
astonished certainty, This explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real and Ive 
got one --- maybe two --- 

He held up the Snitch. 

--- and You-Know-Whos chasing the third, but he doesnt realizehe just 
thinks its a powerful wand --- 

Harry, said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lilys letter, 
Im sorry, but I think youve got this wrong, all wrong. 

But dont you see? It all fits --- 

Not, it doesnt, she said. It doesnt. Harry, youre just getting carried away. 
Please, she said as she started to speak, please just answer me this: If the Deathly 
Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who 
possessed all of them would be master of Death --- Harry, why wouldnt he have told 
you? Why? 

He had his answer ready. 

But you said it, Hermione! Youve got to find out about them for yourself! Its a 
Quest! 

But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods! cried 
Hermione in exasperation. I didnt really believe it! 

Harry took no notice. 

Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my strength, 
take risks. This feels like the kind of thing hed do. 

Harry, this isnt a game, this isnt practice! This is the real thing, and 
Dumbledore left you very clear instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That 
symbol doesnt mean anything, forget the Deathly Hallows, we cant afford to get 
sidetracked --- 

Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his 
hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to 
Hermione that he was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real. 

She appealed to Ron. 

You dont believe in this, do you? 

Harry looked up, Ron hesitated. 

I dunnoI meanbits of it sort of fit together, said Ron awkwardly, But 
when you look at the whole thing He took a deep breath. I think were supposed to 
get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. Thats what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybemaybe we 
should forget about this Hallows business. 

Thank you, Ron, said Hermione. Ill take first watch. 

And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to 
a fierce full stop. 


But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken 
possession of him, and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his 
mind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if he could just possess them all 

I open at the closeBut what was the close? Why couldnt he have the stone 
now? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in personand 
Harry murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even 
Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not open 

And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Voldemort 
searching now? Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemorts thoughts, 
because for the first time ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same 
thingHermione would not like that idea, of courseBut then, she did not 
believe.Xenophilius had been right, in a wayLimited, Narrow, Close-minded. The 
truth was that she was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, especially of the 
Resurrection Stoneand Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly 
swallowing it, but the cold medal did not yield 

It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban, 
surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten all 
about her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her, but 
dementors in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. Now he came to think about 
it, he had not tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wandHe must try that in the 
morning 

If only there was a way of getting a better wand 

And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible, swallowed 
him once more 

They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of 
rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and 
persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and 
depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had 
been lit inside him that nothing, not Hermiones flat disbelief nor Rons persistent doubts, 
could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the 
less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined indifference 
was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his 
certainty, which remained absolute. Harrys belief in and longing for the Hallows 
consumed him so much that he felt isolated from the other two and their obsession with 
the Horcruxes. 

Obsession? said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless 
enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of 
interest in locating more Horcruxes. Were not the one with an obsession, Harry! Were 
the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do! 

But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the 
Hallows for Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left 
the Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other 
survivesmaster of DeathWhy didnt Ron and Hermione understand? 

The last enemy shall be destroyed is death, Harry quoted calmly. 

I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting? Hermione 
retorted, and Harry gave up on her. 


Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing, 
seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing 
that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he 
could to hide this fact from the other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but 
was disappointed by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had 
changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in and 
out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that 
looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance. 
Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was worried 
that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that 
he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected 
these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the 
blackthorn wands fault that he could no longer see into Voldemorts mind as well as 
before. 

As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new self-
absorption, that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to 
make up for having walked out on them, perhaps because Harrys descent into 
listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now 
encouraging and exhorting the other two into action. 

Three Horcruxes left, he kept saying. We need a plan of action, come on! 
Where havent we looked? Lets go through it again. The orphanage 

Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every 
place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, Ron and 
Hermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. 
He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemorts thoughts, to 
find out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more 
unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep them moving. 

You never know, was Rons constant refrain. Upper Flagley is a Wizarding 
village, he mightve wanted to live there. Lets go and have a poke around. 

These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occasional 
sight of Snatchers. 

Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters, said Ron. The lot that 
got me were a bit pathetic, but Bill recons some of them are really dangerous. They said 
on Potterwatch --- 

On what? said Harry. 

Potterwatch, didnt I tell you thats what it was called? The program I keep 
trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the truth about whats going on! Nearly 
all of the programs are following You-Know-Whos line, all except Potterwatch, I really 
want you to hear it, but its tricky tuning in 

Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on 
top of the wireless while the dials whirled. Occasionally they would catch snatches of 
advice on how to treat dragonpox, and once a few bars of A Cauldron Full of Hot, 
Strong Love. While he taped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct password, 
muttering strings of random words under his breath. 

Theyre normally something to do with the Order, he told them. Bill had a real 
knack for guessing them. Im bound to get one in the end 


But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the tent 
entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their 
way through the chilly ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent. 

Ive got it, Ive got it! Password was Albus! Get in here, Harry. 

Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, 
Harry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside 
the little radio. Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for 
something to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a 
most familiar voice was issuing. 

apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was due to a 
number of house calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters. 

But thats Lee Jordan! said Hermione. 

I know! beamed Ron. Cool, eh? 

now found ourselves another secure location, Lee was saying, and Im 
pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. 
Evening, boys! 

Hi. 

Evening, River. 

River thats Lee, Ron explained. Theyve all got code names, but you can 
usually tell --- 

Shh! said Hermione. 

But before we hear from Royal and Romulus, Lee went on, lets take a 
moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily 
Prophet dont think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform 
our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell. 

Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at one 
another in horror. 

A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born 
Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, 
Cresswell, and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any 
knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news. 

Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their 
home. Muggle authorities are attributing their deaths to a gas leak, but members of the 
Order of the Phoenix inform me that it was the Killing Curse --- more evidence, as if it 
were needed, of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational 
sport under the new regime. 

Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot 
have been discovered in Godrics Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months 
ago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of 
injuries inflicted by Dark Magic. 

Listeners, Id like to invite you now to join us in a minutes silence in memory of 
Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less 
regretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters. 

Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned 
to hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had 
felt fully connected to the outside world for a long time. 


Thank you, said Lees voice. And now we can return to regular contributor 
Royal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world. 

Thanks, River, said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured, reassuring. 

Kingsley! burst out Ron. 

We know! said Hermione, hushing him. 

Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to 
sustain heavy casualties, said Kingsley. However, we continue to hear truly 
inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle 
friends and neighbors, often without the Muggles knowledge. Id like to appeal to all our 
listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any 
Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are 
taken. 

And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these 
dangerous times, it should be Wizards first? asked Lee. 

Id say that its one short step from Wizards first to Purebloods first, and then 
to Death Eaters, replied Kingsley. Were all human, arent we? Every human life is 
worth the same, and worth saving. 

Excellently put, Royal, and youve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever 
get out of this mess, said Lee. And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature Pals 
of Potter. 

Thanks, River, said another very familiar voice. Ron started to speak, but 
Hermione forestalled him in a whisper. 

We know its Lupin! 

Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time youve appeared on our 
program, that Harry Potter is still alive? 

I do, said Lupin firmly. There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death 
would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, 
because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. 
The Boy Who Lived remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the 
triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting. 

A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him, 
then, for the terrible things he had said when they had last met? 

And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus? 

Id tell him were all with him in spirit, said Lupin, then hesitated slightly, 
And Id tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right. 

Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears. 

Nearly always right, she repeated. 

Oh, didnt I tell you? said Ron in surprise. Bill told me Lupins living with 
Tonks again! And apparently shes getting pretty big too 

and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potters who are suffering for 
their allegiance? Lee was saying. 

 Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of 
Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile 
editor of The Quibbler, said Lupin. 

 At least hes still alive! muttered Ron. 


 We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid C all three of 
them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence -- well-known gamekeeper at 
Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he 
is rumored to have hosted a Support Harry Potter party in his house. However, Hagrid 
was not taken into custody, and is, we believe, on the run. 

 I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if youve got a sixteen-
foot-high half brother? asked Lee. 

 It would tend to give you an edge, agreed Lupin gravely. May I just add that 
while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrids spirit, we would urge even the most 
devoted of Harrys supporters against following Hagrids lead. Support Harry Potter 
parties are unwise in the present climate. 

 Indeed they are, Romulus, said Lee, so we suggest that you continue to show 
your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now 
lets move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. 
We like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of 
the more insane rumors circulating about him, Id like to introduce a new correspondent. 
Rodent? 

 Rodent? said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried 
out together: 

 Fred! 

 No C is it George? 

 Its Fred, I think, said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said, 

 Im not being Rodent, no way, I told you I wanted to be Rapier! 

 Oh, all right then, Rapier, could you please give us your take on the various 
stories weve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater? 

 Yes, River, I can, said Fred. As our listeners will know, unless theyve taken 
refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Whos strategy 
of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the 
alleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos 
running around the place. 

 Which suits him, of course, said Kingsley. The air of mystery is creating more 
terror than actually showing himself. 

 Agreed, said Fred. So, people, lets try and calm down a bit. Things are bad 
enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who 
can kill people with a single glance from his eyes. Thats a basilisk, listeners. One simple 
test: Check whether the thing thats glaring at you has got legs. If it has, its safe to look 
into its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, thats still likely to be the last thing 
you ever do. 

 For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He could feel the 
weight of tension leaving him. 

 And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad? asked Lee. 

 Well, who wouldnt want a nice little holiday after all the hard work hes been 
putting in? asked Fred. Point is, people, dont get lulled into a false sense of security, 
thinking hes out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isnt, but the fact remains he can 
move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so dont 


count on him being a long way away if youre planning to take any risks. I never thought 
Id hear myself say it, but safety first! 

 Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier, said Lee. Listeners, that 
brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We dont know when it will be possible to 
broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The 
next password will be Mad-Eye. Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night. 

 The radios dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an 
extraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten 
that other people were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep. 

 Good, eh? said Ron happily. 

 Brilliant, said Harry. 

 Its so brave of them, sighed Hermione admiringly. If they were found  

 Well, they keep on the move, dont they? said Ron. Like us. 

 But did you hear what Fred said? asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was 
over, his thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. Hes abroad! Hes 
still looking for the Wand, I knew it! 

 Harry 

 Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol C 

 HARRY, NO! 

 demorts after the Elder Wand! 

 The names Taboo! Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded 
outside the tent. I told you, Harry, I told you, we cant say it anymore C weve got to put 
the protection back around us C quickly C its how they find C 

 But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had 
lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited 
voices. Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their lamps went out. 

 Come out of there with your hands up! came a rasping voice through the 
darkness. We know youre in there! Youve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and 
we dont care who we curse! 

 

 

Chapter Twenty-Three 

Malfoy Manor 

 

Harry looked around at the other two, now mere outlines in the darkness. He saw 
Hermione point her wand, set toward the outside, but into his face; there was a bang, a 
burst of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable to see. He could feel his face 
swelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him. 

 "Get up, vermin." 

 Unknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground, before he could stop them, 
someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry 
clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, 
tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction. His 


eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he 
was bundled out of the tent: all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five 
people wrestling Ron and Hermione outside too. 

 "Get -- off - her!" Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles 
hitting flesh: Ron grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, "No! Leave him alone, leave 
him alone!" 

 "Your boyfriend's going to have worse than that done to him if he's on my list," 
said the horribly familiar, rasping voice. "Delicious girl... what a treat . . . I do enjoy the 
softness of the skin. . . ." 

 Harry's stomach turned over. He knew who this was, Fenrit Greyback, the 
werewolf who was permitted to wear Death Eater robes in return for his hired savagery. 

 "Search the tent!" said another voice. 

 Harry was thrown face down onto the ground. A thud told him that Ron had been 
cast down beside him. They could hear footsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over 
chairs inside the tent as they searched. 

 "Now, let's see who we've got," said Greyback's gloating voice from overhead, 
and Harry was rolled over onto his back. A beam of wand light fell onto his face and 
Greyback laughed. 

 "I'll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. What happened to you, ugly?" 

 Harry did not answer immediately. 

 "I said," repeated Greyback, and Harry received a blow to the diaphragm that 
made him double over in pain. "what happened to you?" 

 "Stung." Harry muttered. "Been Stung." 

 "Yeah, looks like it." said a second voice. 

 "Whats your name?" snarled Greyback. 

 "Dudley." said Harry. 

 "And your first name?" 

 "I -- Vernon. Vernon Dudley." 

 "Check the list, Scabior." said Greyback, and Harry head him move sideways to 
look down at Ron, instead. "And what about you, ginger?" 

 "Stan Shunpike." said Ron. 

 "Like 'ell you are." said the man called Scabior. "We know Stan Shunpike, 'e's put 
a bit of work our way." 

 There was another thud. 

 "I'b Bardy," said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood. 
"Bardy Weasley." 

 "A Weasley?" rasped Greyback. "So you're related to blood traitors even if you're 
not a Mudblood. And lastly, your pretty little friend . . ." The relish in his voice made 
Harry's flesh crawl. 

 "Easy, Greyback." said Scabior over the jeering of the others. 

 "Oh, I'm not going to bite just yet. We'll see if shes a bit quicker at remembering 
her name than Barny. Who are you, girly? 

 "Penelope Clearwater." said Hermione. She sounded terrified, but convincing. 

 "What's your blood status?" 

 "Half-Blood." said Hermione. 


 "Easy enough to check," said Scabior. "But the 'ole lot of 'em look like they could 
still be 'ogwarts age -" 

 "We'b lebt," said Ron. 

 "Left, 'ave you, ginger?" said Scabior. "And you decided to go camping? And you 
thought, just for a laugh, you'd use the Dark Lords name?" 

 "Nod a laugh," said Ron. "Aggiden." 

 "Accident?" There was more jeering laughter. 

 "You know who used to like using the Dark Lord's name, Weasley?" growled 
Greyback, "The Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you?" 

 "Doh." 

 "Well, they don't show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name's been Tabooed. 
A few Order members have been tracked that way. We'll see. Bind them up with the 
other two prisoners!" 

 Someone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a short way, pushed him 
down into a sitting position, then started binding him back-to-back with other people. 
Harry was still half blind, barely able to see anything through his puffed-up eyes. When 
at last the man tying then had walked away, Harry whispered to the other prisoners. 

 "Anyone still got a wand?" 

 "No." Said Ron and Hermione from either side of him. 

 "This is all my fault. I said the name. I'm sorry -" 

 "Harry?" 

 It was a new, but familiar voice. and it came from directly behind Harry, from the 
person tied to Hermione's left. 

 "Dean?" 

 "It is you! If they find out who they've got -! They're Snatchers, they're only 
looking for truants to sell for gold -" 

 "Not a bad little haul for one night." Greyback was saying, as a pair of hobnailed 
boots marched close by Harry and they heard more crashes from inside the tent. "A 
Mudblood, a runaway goblin, and these truants. You checked their names on the list yet, 
Scabior?" he roared. 

 "Yeah. There's no Vernon Dudley un 'ere, Greyback." 

 "Interesting," said Greyback. "That's interesting." 

 He crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through the infinitesimal gap left 
between his swollen eyelids, a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers, with 
pointed brown teeth and sores in the corners of his mouth. Greyback smelled as he had 
done at the top of the tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, and blood. 

 "So you aren't wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a different 
name? What house were you in at Hogwarts?" 

 "Slytherin," said Harry automatically. 

 "Funny 'ow they all thinks we wants to 'ear that." leered Scabior out of the 
shadows. "But none of 'em can tell us where the common room is." 

 "It's in the dungeons." said Harry clearly. "You enter through the wall. It's full of 
skulls and stuff and its under the lake, so the light's all green," 

 There was a short pause. 


 "Well, well, looks like we really 'ave caught a little Slytherin." said Scabior. 
"Good for you, Vernon, 'cause there ain't a lot of Mudblood Slytherins. Who's your 
father?" 

 "He works at the Ministry," Harry lied. He knew that his whole story would 
collapse with the smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until his face 
regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case. "Department of 
Magical Accidents and Catastrophes." 

 "You know what, Greyback," said Scabior. "I think there is a Dudley in there." 

 Harry could barely breathe: Could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of this? 

 "Well, well." said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation 
in that callous voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had just indeed 
just attacked and bound the son of a Ministry Official. Harry's heart was pounding against 
the ropes around his ribs; he would not have been surprised to know that Greyback could 
see it. "If you're telling the truth, ugly, you've got nothing to fear from a trip to the 
Ministry. I expect your father'll reward us just for picking you up." 

 "But," said Harry, his mouth bone dry, "if you just let us -" 

 "Hey!" came a shout from inside the tent. "Look at this. Greyback!" 

 A dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint of silver to the 
light of their wands. They had found Gryffindor's sword. 

 "Ve-e-ery nice," said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his companion. "Oh, 
very nice indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get something like this?" 

 "It's my father's," Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark for 
Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. "We borrowed it to cut firewood -" 

 "'ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the Prophet!" 

 As Scabior said it, Harry's scar, which was stretched tight across his distended 
forehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he could make out anything around him, he 
saw a towering building, a grim fortress, jet-black and forbidding: Voldemort's thoughts 
had suddenly become Razor-Sharp again; he was gliding toward the gigantic building 
with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose . . . 

 So close . . . So close . . . 

With a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to Voldemort's thoughts, pulling himself 
back to where he sat, tied to Ron, Hermione, Dean, and Griphook in the darkness, 
listening to Greyback and Scabior. 

"'Hermione Granger," Scabior was saying, "the Mudblood who is known to be traveling 
with 'arry Potter." 

 Harry's scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep himself 
present, nor to slip into Voldemort's mind. He heard the creak of Greyback's boots as he 
crouched down, in front of Hermione. 

 "you know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you." 

 "It isn't! It isn't me!" 

 Hermione's terrified squeak was as good as a confession. 

 "... known to be traveling with Harry Potter," repeated Greyback quietly. 

 A stillness had settled over the scene. Harry's scar was Exquisitely painful, but he 
struggled with all his strength against the pull of Voldemort's thoughts. It had never been 
so important to remain in his own right mind. 


 "Well, this changed things, doesn't it?" whispered Greyback. Nobody spoke: 
Harry sensed the gang of Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt Hermione's arm trembling 
against his. Greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where Harry sat, crouching 
down again to stare closely at his misshapen features. 

 "What's that on your forehead, Vernon?" he asked softly, his breath foul in 
Harry's nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taught scar. 

 "Don't touch it! Harry yelled; he could not stop himself, he thought he might be 
sick from the pain of it. 

 "I thought you wore glasses, Potter?" breathed Greyback. 

 "I found glasses!" yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the background. "There 
was glasses in the tent, Greyback, wait -" 

 And seconds later Harry's glasses had been rammed back onto his face. The 
Snatchers were closing in now, peering at him. 

 "It Is!" rasped Greyback. "We've caught Potter!" 

 They all took several steps backward, stunned by what they had done. Harry, still 
fighting to remain present in his own splitting head, could think of nothing to say. 
Fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind - 

 --He was hiding around the high walls of the black fortress-- 

 No, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger-- 

 --looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower-- 

 He was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in low voices-- 

 --Time to fly . . . 

 ". . . To the Ministry?" 

 "To hell with the Ministry." growled Greyback. "They'll take the credit, and we 
won't get a look in. I say we take him straight to You-Know-Who." 

 "Will you summon 'im? 'ere?" said Scabior, sounding awed, terrified. 

 "No," snarled Greyback, "I haven't got -- they say he's using the Malfoy's place as 
a base. We'll take the boy there." 

 Harry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling Voldemort. The werewolf 
might be allowed to wear Death Eater robes when they wanted to use him, but only 
Voldemort's inner circle were branded with the Dark Mark: Greyback had not been 
granted this highest honor. 

Harrys scar seared again C 

C and he rose into the night, flying straight up to the windows at the very top of 
the tower C 

. . . completely sure its him? Cause if it aint, Greyback, were dead. 

Whos in charge here? roared Greyback, covering his moment of inadequacy. I 
say thats Potter, and him plus his wand, thats two hundred thousand Galleons right 
there! But if youre too gutless to come along, any of you, its all for me, and with any 
luck, Ill get the girl thrown in! 

 C The window was the merest slit in the black rock, not big enough for a man to 
enter. . . . A skeletal figure was just visible through it, curled beneath a blanket. . . . Dead, 
or sleeping . . . ? 

All right! said Scabior. All right, were in! And what about the rest of em, 
Greyback, whatll we do with em? 


Might as well take the lot. Weve got two Mudbloods, thats another ten 
Galleons. Give me the sword as well. If theyre rubies, thats another small fortune right 
there. 

The prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry could hear Hermiones breathing, 
fast and terrified. 

Grab hold and make it tight. Ill do Potter! said Greyback, seizing a fistful of 
Harrys hair; Harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp. On three! One C 
two C three C 

They Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry struggled, trying to 
throw off Greybacks hand, but it was hopeless: Ron and Hermione were squeezed tightly 
against him on either side; he could not separate from the group, and as the breath was 
squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still C 

 C as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed, 
lightly as vapor inside the cell-like room C 

 The prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane. Harrys 
eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates 
at the foot of what looked like a long drive. He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. 
The worst had not happened yet: Voldemort was not here. He was, Harry knew, for he 
was fighting to resist the vision, in some strange, fortresslike place, at the top of a tower. 
How long it would take Voldemort to get to this place, once he knew that Harry was here, 
was another matter. . . . 

 One of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them. 

 How do we get in? Theyre locked, Greyback, I cant C blimey! 

 He whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was contorting, twisting itself out 
of the abstract furls and coils into a frightening face, which spoke in a clanging, echoing 
voice. State your purpose! 

 Weve got Potter! Greyback roared triumphantly. Weve captured Harry 
Potter! 

 The gates swung open. 

 Come on! said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were shunted through the 
gates and up the drive, between high hedges that muffled their footsteps. Harry saw a 
ghostly white shape above him, and realized it was an albino peacock. He stumbled and 
was dragged onto his feet by Greyback; now he was staggering along sideways, tied 
back-to-back to the four other prisoner. Closing his puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his 
scar to overcome him for a moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing, 
whether he knew yet that Harry was caught. . . . 

 The emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him, 
eyes opening in a skull of a face. . . . The frail man sat up, great sunken eyes fixed upon 
him, upon Voldemort, and then he smiled. Most of his teeth were gone. . . . 

 So, you have come. I thought you would . . . one day. But your journey was 
pointless. I never had it. 

 You lie! 

 As Voldemorts anger throbbed inside him, Harrys scar threatened to burst with 
pain, and he wrenched his mind back to his own body, fighting to remain present as the 
prisoners were pushed over gravel. 


 Light spilled out over all of them. 

 What is this? said a womans cold voice. 

 Were here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named! rasped Greyback. 

 Who are you? 

 You know me! There was resentment in the werewolfs voice. Fenrit 
Greyback! Weve caught Harry Potter! 

 Greyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the light, forcing the other 
prisoners to shuffle around too. 

 I know es swollen, maam, but its im! piped up Scabior. If you look a bit 
closer, youll see is scar. And this ere, see the girl? The Mudblood whos been traveling 
around with im, maam. Theres no doubt its im, and weve got is wand as well! Ere, 
maam C 

 Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen 
face. Scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her. She raised her eyebrows. 

 Bring them in, she said. 

 Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway 
lined with portraits. 

 Follow me, said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. My son, Draco, is 
home for his Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter, he will know. 

 The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost 
closed Harry could make out the wide proportions of the room. A crystal chandelier hung 
from the ceiling, more portraits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from 
chairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by 
the Snatchers. 

 What is this? 

 The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harrys ears. He 
was panicking now. He could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to 
block out Voldemorts thoughts, though his scar was still burning. 

 They say theyve got Potter, said Narcissas cold voice. Draco, come here. 
Harry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely; a figure slightly 
taller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath 
white-blond hair. 

 Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath 
the chandelier. 

 Well, boy? rasped the werewolf. 

 Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing in an intricately 
scrolled frame. Through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time 
since leaving Grimmauld Place. 

 His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermiones jinx. 
His black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he 
not known that it was he who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing his 
glasses. He resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still 
avoided eye contact with Draco as the latter approached. 

 Well, Draco? said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. Is it? Is it Harry Potter? 
I cant C I cant be sure, said Draco. He was keeping his distance from 
Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him. 


 But look at him carefully, look! Come closer! 

 Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited. 

 Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will 
be forgiv C 

 Now, we wont be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope Mr. Malfoy? said 
Greyback menacingly. 

 Of course not, of course not! said Lucius impatiently. He approached Harry 
himself, came so close that Harry could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail 
even through his swollen eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was 
peering out from between the bars of a cage. 

 What did you do to him? Lucius asked Greyback. How did he get into this 
state? 

 That wasnt us. 
Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me, said Lucius. 

 His gray eyes raked Harrys forehead. 

 Theres something there, he whispered. it could be the scar, stretched 
tight. . . . Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think? 

 Harry saw Dracos face up close now, right beside his fathers. They were 
extraordinarily alike, except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement, 
Dracos expression was full of reluctance, even fear. 

 I dont know, he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his 
mother stood watching. 

 We had better be certain, Lucius, Narcissa called to her husband in her cold, 
clear voice. Completely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the Dark Lord . . . They 
say this is his C she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand C but it does not 
resemble Ollivanders description. . . . If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here 
for nothing . . . Remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov? 

 What about the Mudblood, then? growled Greyback. Harry was nearly thrown 
off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that the light 
fell on Hermione instead. 

 Wait, said Narcissa sharply. Yes C yes, she was in Madam Malkins with 
Potter! I saw her picture in the Prophet! Look, Draco, isnt it the Granger girl? 

 I . . . maybe . . . yeah. 

 But then, thats the Weasley boy! shouted Lucius, striding around the bound 
prisoners to face Ron. Its them, Potters friends C Draco, look at him, isnt it Arthur 
Weasleys son, whats his name C ? 

 Yeah, said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. It could be. 

 The drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the sound of 
the voice wound Harrys fear to an even higher pitch. 

 What is this? Whats happened, Cissy? 

 Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on Harrys 
right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes, 

 But surely, she said quietly, this is the Mudblood girl? This is Grander? 

 Yes, yes, its Granger! cried Lucius, And beside her, we think, Potter! Potter 
and his friends, caught at last! 
Potter? shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in Harry. 


Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once! 
She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the flesh 
of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her beloved masterC 

 I was about to call him! said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon 
Bellatrixs wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. I shall summon him, Bella. 
Potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my authority C 

 Your authority! she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp. 
You lost your authority when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare you! Take your 
hands off me! 

 This is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the boy C 

 Begging your pardon, Mr. Malfoy, interjected Greyback, but its us that caught 
Potter, and its us thatll be claiming the gold C 

 Gold! laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off her brother-in-law, her 
free hand groping in her pocket for her wand. Take your gold, filthy scavenger, what do 
I want with gold? I seek only the honor of his C of C 

 She stopped struggling, her dark eyes fixed upon something Harry could not see. 
Jubilant at her capitulation, Lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve 
C 

 STOP! shrieked Bellatrix, Do not touch it, we shall all perish if the Dark Lord 
comes now! 

 Lucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own Mark. Bellatrix strode out of 
Harrys limited line of vision. 

 What is that? he heard her say. 

 Sword, grunted an out-of-sight Snatcher. 

 Give it to me. 

 Its not yours, missus, its mine, I reckon I found it. 

 There was a bang and a flash of red light; Harry knew that the Snatcher had been 
Stunned. There was a roar of anger from his fellows: Scabior drew his wand. 

 What dyou think youre playing at, woman? 

 Stupefy! she screamed, Stupefy! 

 They were no match for her, even thought there were four of them against one of 
her: She was a witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no conscience. They fell 
where they stood, all except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his 
arms outstretched. Out of the corners of his eyes Harry saw Bellatrix bearing down upon 
the werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen. 

 Where did you get this sword? she whispered to Greyback as she pulled his 
wand out of his unresisting grip. 

 How dare you? he snarled, his mouth the only thing that could move as he was 
forced to gaze up at her. He bared his pointed teeth. Release me, woman! 
Where did you find this sword? she repeated, brandishing it in his face, Snape 
sent it to my vault in Gringotts! 

 It was in their tent, rasped Greyback. Release me, I say! 

 She waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but appeared too wary 
to approach her. He prowled behind an armchair, his filthy curved nails clutching its back. 

 Draco, move this scum outside, said Bellatrix, indicating the unconscious men. 
If you havent got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me. 


 Dont you dare speak to Draco like C said Narcissa furiously, but Bellatrix 
screamed. 

 Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Cissy! We have 
a very serious problem! 

 She stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examining its hilt. Then 
she turned to look at the silent prisoners. 

 If it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed, she muttered, more to herself than 
to the others. The Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter himself. . . . But if he finds 
out . . . I must . . . I must know. . . . 

 She turned back to her sister again. 

The prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I think what to do! 
This is my house, Bella, you dont give orders in my C 

Do it! You have no idea of the danger were in! shrieked Bellatrix. She looked 
frightening, mad; a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the 
carpet. 

Narcissa hesitated for a moment, then addressed the werewolf. 

Take these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback. 

Wait, said Bellatrix sharply. All except. . . . except for the Mudblood. 
Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure. 

No! shouted Ron. You can have me, keep me! 
Bellatrix hit him across the face: the blow echoed around the room. 

If she dies under questioning, Ill take you next, she said. Blood traitor is next 
to Mudblood in my book. Take them downstairs, Greyback, and make sure they are 
secure, but do nothing more to them C yet. 

She threw Greybacks wand back to him, then took a short silver knife from under 
her robes. She cut Hermione free from the other prisoners, then dragged her by the hair 
into the middle of the room, while Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to 
another door, into a dark passageway, his wand held out in front of him, projecting an 
invisible and irresistible force. 

Reckon shell let me have a bit of the girl when shes finished with her? 
Greyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor. Id say Ill get a bite or two, 
wouldnt you, ginger? 

Harry could feel Ron shaking. They were forced down a steep flight of stairs, still 
tied back-to-back and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment. At 
the bottom was a heavy door. Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced 
them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness. The echoing bang of the 
slammed cellar door had not died away before there was a terrible, drawn out scream 
from directly above them. 

HERMIONE! Ron bellowed, and he started to writhe and struggle against the 
ropes tying them together, so that Harry staggered. HERMIONE! 

Be quiet! Harry said. Shut up. Ron, we need to work out a way C 

HERMIONE! HERMIONE! 

We need a plan, stop yelling C we need to get these ropes off C 

Harry? came a whisper through the darkness. Ron? Is that you? 

Ron stopped shouting. There was a sound of movement close by them, then Harry 
saw a shadow moving closer. 


Harry? Ron? 

Luna? 

Yes, its me! Oh no, I didnt want you to be caught! 

Luna, can you help us get these ropes off? said Harry. 

Oh yes, I expect so. . . . Theres an old nail we use if we need to break 
anything. . . . Just a moment . . . 

Hermione screamed again from overhead, and they could hear Bellatrix 
screaming too, but her words were inaudible, for Ron shouted again, HERMIONE! 
HERMIONE! 

Mr. Ollivander? Harry could hear Luna saying. Mr. Ollivander, have you got 
the nail? If you just move over a little bit . . . I think it was beside the water jug. 

She was back within seconds. 

Youll need to stay still, she said. 

Harry could feel her digging at the ropes tough fibers to work the knots free. 
From upstairs they heard Bellatrixs voice. 

Im going to ask you again! Where did you get this sword? Where? 

We found it C we found it C PLEASE! Hermione screamed again; Ron 
struggled harder than ever, and the rusty nail slipped onto Harrys wrist. 

Ron, please stay still! Luna whispered. I cant see what Im doing C 

My pocket! said Ron, In my pocket, theres a Deluminator, and its full of 
light! 

A few seconds later, there was a click, and the luminescent spheres the 
Deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar: Unable to rejoin 
their sources, they simply hung there, like tiny suns, flooding the underground room with 
light. Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her white face, and the motionless figure of Ollivander 
the wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the corner. Craning around, he caught sight of 
their fellow prisoners: Dean and Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious, kept 
standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans. 

Oh, thats much easier, thanks, Ron, said Luna, and she began hacking at their 
bindings again. Hello, Dean! 

From above came Bellatrixs voice. 

Youre lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been inside my vault at 
Gringotts! Tell the truth, tell the truth! 

Another terrible screamC 

HERMIONE! 

What else did you take? What else have you got? Tel me the truth or, I swear, I 
shall run you through with this knife! 

There! 

Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see Ron running 
around the cellar, looking up at the low ceiling, searching for a trapdoor. Dean, his face 
bruised and bloody, said Thanks to Luna and stood there, shivering, but Griphook sank 
onto the cellar floor, looking groggy and disoriented, many welts across his swarthy face. 

Ron was now trying to Disapparate without a wand. 

Theres no way out, Ron, said Luna, watching his fruitless efforts. The cellar 
is completely escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time, 
hes tried everything. 


Hermione was screaming again: The sound went through Harry like physical pain. 
Barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar, he too started to run around the cellar, 
feeling the walls for he hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless. 

What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO! 

Hermiones screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ron was half sobbing as he 
pounded the walls with his fists, and Harry in utter desperation seized Hagrids pouch 
from around his neck and groped inside it: He pulled out Dumbledores Snitch and shook 
it, hoping for he did not know what C nothing happened C he waved the broken halves of 
the phoenix wand, but they were lifeless C the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, 
and he saw a gleam of brightest blue C 

Dumbledores eye was gazing at him out of the mirror. 

Help us! he yelled at it in mad desperation. Were in the cellar of Malfoy 
Manor, help us! 

The eye blinked and was gone. 

Harry was not even sure that it had really been there. He tilted the shard of mirror 
this way and that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, 
and upstairs Hermione was screaming worse than ever, and next to him Ron was 
bellowing, HERMIONE! HERMIONE! 

How did you get into my vault? they heard Bellatrix scream. Did that dirty 
little goblin in the cellar help you? 

We only met him tonight! Hermione sobbed. Weve never been inside your 
vault. . . . It isnt the real sword! Its a copy, just a copy! 

A copy? screeched Bellatrix. Oh, a likely story! 

But we can find out easily! came Luciuss voice. Draco, fetch the goblin, he 
can tell us whether the sword is real or not! 

Harry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the floor. 

Griphook, he whispered into the goblins pointed ear, you must tell them that 
swords a fake, they mustnt know its the real one, Griphook, please C 

He could hear someone scuttling own the cellar steps; next moment, Dracos 
shaking voice spoke from behind the door. 

Stand back. Line up against the back wall. Dont try anything, or Ill kill you! 

They did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked the Deluminator 
and the lights whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellars darkness. The door flew 
open; Malfoy marched inside, wand held out in front of him, pale and determined. He 
seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again, dragging Griphook with him. 
The door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar. 

Ron clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light flew back into the air from his 
pocket, revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had just Apparated into their midst. 

DOB C ! 

Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked terrified at his 
mistake. Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead: Draco marching Griphook to Bellatrix. 

Dobbys enormous, tennis-ball shaped eyes were wide; he was trembling from his 
feet to the tips of his ears. He was back in the home of his old masters, and it was clear 
that he was petrified. 

Harry Potter, he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, Dobby has come to 
rescue you. 


But how did you C ? 

An awful scream drowned Harrys words: Hermione was being tortured again. He 
cut to the essentials. 

You can Disapparate out of this cellar? he asked Dobby, who nodded, his ears 
flapping. 

And you can take humans with you? 

Dobby nodded again. 

Right. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean, and Mr. Ollivander, and take them 
C take them to C 

Bill and Fleurs, said Ron. Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth! 

The elf nodded for a third time. 

And then come back, said Harry. Can you do that, Dobby? 

Of course, Harry Potter, whispered the little elf. He hurried over to Mr. 
Ollivander, who appeared to be barely conscious. He took one of the wandmakers hands 
in his own, then held out the other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved. 

Harry, we want to help you! Luna whispered. 

We cant leave you here, said Dean. 

Go, both of you! Well see you at Bill and Fleurs. 

As Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few seconds he looked 
down, not upon the wandmaker, but on another man who was just as old, just as thin, but 
laughing scornfully. 

Kill me, then. Voldemort, I welcome death! But my death will not bring you what 
you seek. . . . There is so much you do not understand. . . 

He felt Voldemorts fury, but as Hermione screamed again he shut it out, 
returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present. 

Go! Harry beseeched to Luna and Dean. Go! Well follow, just go! 

They caught hold of the elfs outstretched fingers. There was another loud crack, 
and Dobby, Luna, Dean, and Ollivander vanished. 

What was that? shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads. Did you hear 
that? What was that noise in the cellar? 

Harry and Ron stared at each other. 

Draco C no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check! 

Footsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence. Harry knew that the 
people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar. 

Were going to have to try and tackle him, he whispered to Ron. They had no 
choice: The moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners, 
they were lost. Leave the lights on, Harry added, and as they heard someone 
descending the steps outside the door, they backed against the wall on either side of it. 

Stand back, came Wormtails voice. Stand away from the door. Im coming 
in. 
The door flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar, 
ablaze with light from the three miniature suns floating in midair. Then Harry and Ron 
launched themselves upon him. Ron seized Wormtails wand arm and forced it upwards. 
Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, muffling his voice. Silently they struggled: 
Wormtails wand emitted sparks; his silver hand closed around Harrys throat. 

What is it, Wormtail? called Lucius Malfoy from above. 


Nothing! Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtails wheezy voice. 
All fine! 

Harry could barely breathe. 

Youre going to kill me? Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers. 
After I saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail! 

The silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it: He wrenched himself free, 
astonished, keeping his hand over Wormtails mouth. He saw the ratlike mans small 
watery eyes widen with fear and surprise: He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his 
hand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle 
more powerfully, as though to undo that moment of weakness. 

And well have that, whispered Ron, tugging Wormtails wand from his other 
hand. 

Wandless, helpless, Pettigrews pupils dilated in terror. His eyes had slid from 
Harrys face to something else. His own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward 
his own throat. 

No C 

Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was no 
stopping it. The silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had 
turned upon its disarmed and useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his 
hesitation, his moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes. 

No! 

Ron had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried to pull the 
crushing metal fingers from around Wormtails throat, but it was no use. Pettigrew was 
turning blue. 

Relashio! said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing happened; 
Pettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, Hermione gave a dreadful 
scream from overhead. Wormtails eyes rolled upward in his purple face; he gave a last 
twitch, and was still. 

Harry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving Wormtails body on the floor 
behind them, ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the 
drawing room. Cautiously they crept along it until they reached the drawing room door, 
which was ajar. Now they had a clear view of Bellatrix looking down at Griphook, who 
was holding Gryffindors sword in his long-fingered hands. Hermione was lying at 
Bellatrixs feet. She was barely stirring. 

Well? Bellatrix said to Griphook. Is it the true sword? 

Harry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling of his scar. 

No, said Griphook. It is a fake. 

Are you sure? panted Bellatrix. Quite sure? 

Yes, said the goblin. 

Relief broke across her face, all tension drained from it. 

Good, she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut 
into the goblins face, and he dropped with a yell at her feet. She kicked him aside. And 
now, she said in a voice that burst with triumph, we call the Dark Lord! 

And she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the Dark Mark. 

At once, Harrys scar felt as though it had split open again. His true surroundings 
vanished: He was Voldemort, and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing 


toothlessly at him; he was enraged at the summons he felt C he had warned them, he had 
told them to summon him for nothing less than Potter. If they were mistaken . . . 

Kill me, then! demanded the old man. You will not win, you cannot win! That 
wand will never, ever be yours C 

And Voldemorts fury broke: A burst of green light filled the prison room and the 
frail old body was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back, lifeless, and Voldemort 
returned to the window, his wrath barely controllable. . . . They would suffer his 
retribution if they had no good reason for calling him back. . . . 

And I think, said Bellatrixs voice, we can dispose of the Mudblood. Greyback, 
take her if you want her. 

NOOOOOOOOOOOO! 

Ron had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked around, shocked; she 
turned her wand to face Ron instead C 

Expelliarmus! he roared, pointing Wormtails wand at Bellatrix, and hers flew 
into the air and was caught by Harry, who had sprinted after Ron. Lucius, Narcissa, 
Draco and Greyback wheeled about; Harry yelled, Stupefy! and Lucius Malfoy 
collapsed onto the hearth. Jets of light flew from Dracos, Narcissas, and Greybacks 
wands; Harry threw himself to the floor, rolling behind a sofa to avoid them. 

STOP OR SHE DIES! 

Panting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix was supporting 
Hermione, who seemed to be unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife to 
Hermiones throat. 

Drop your wands, she whispered. Drop them, or well see exactly how filthy 
her blood is! 

Ron stood rigid, clutching Wormtails wand. Harry straightened up, still holding 
Bellatrixs. 

I said, drop them! she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermiones throat: 
Harry saw beads of blood appear there. 

All right! he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrixs wand onto the floor at his feet, 
Ron did the same with Wormtails. Both raised their hands to shoulder height. 

Good! she leered. Draco, pick them up! The Dark Lord is coming, Harry 
Potter! Your death approaches! 

Harry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel 
Voldemort flying through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon he 
would be close enough to Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out. 

Now, said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to her with the wands. Cissy, 
I think we ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes care of Miss 
Mudblood. I am sure the Dark Lord will not begrudge you the girl, Greyback, after what 
you have done tonight. 

At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. All of them 
looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and an 
ominous jingling, it began to fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, 
she threw herself aside with a scream. The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion 
of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the 
sword of Gryffindor. Glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions; Draco doubled 
over, his hands covering his bloody face. 


As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took the chance: He 
leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Dracos grip, pointed all of 
them at Greyback, and yelled, Stupefy! The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the 
triple spell, flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground. 

As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix sprang to her 
feet, her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had directed her wand 
at the doorway. 

Dobby! she screamed and even Bellatrix froze. You! You dropped the 
chandelier C ? 

The tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress. 

You must not hurt Harry Potter, he squeaked. 

Kill him, Cissy! shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud crack, and 
Narcissas wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room. 

You dirty little monkey! bawled Bellatrix. How dare you take a witchs wand, 
how dare you defy your masters? 

Dobby has no master! squealed the elf. Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has 
come to save Harry Potter and his friends! 

Harrys scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he knew that they had moments, 
seconds before Voldemort was with them. 

Ron, catch C and GO! he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him; then he bent 
down to tug Griphook out from under the chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who 
still clung to the sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobbys hand and spun on the 
spot to Disapparate. 

As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the 
pale, frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was Rons hair, and a 
blue of flying silver, as Bellatrixs knife flew across the room at the place where he was 
vanishing C 

Bill and Fleurs . . . Shell Cottage . . . Bill and Fleurs . . . 

He had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the name of the 
destination and hope that it would suffice to take him there. The pain in his forehead 
pierced him, and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of 
Gryffindors sword bumping against his back: Dobbys hand jerked in his; he wondered 
whether the elf was trying to take charge, to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by 
squeezing the fingers, to indicate that that was fine with them. . . . 

And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to his knees, 
relinquished Dobbys hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground. 

Are you all right? he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered. 

Harry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to be a cottage a short 
way away under the wide starry sky, and he thought he saw movement outside it. 

Dobby, is this Shell Cottage? he whispered, clutching the two wands he had 
brought from the Malfoys, ready to fight if he needed to. Have we come to the right 
place? Dobby? 

He looked around. The little elf stood feet from him. 

DOBBY! 

The elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes. Together, he and 
Harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elfs heaving chest. 


Dobby C no C HELP! Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people 
moving there. HELP! 

He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; 
all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobbys front, and that he 
had stretched out his own arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him 
and laid him sideways on the cool grass. 

Dobby, no, dont die, dont die C 

The elfs eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. 

Harry . . . Potter . . . 

And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing 
more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see. 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter Twenty-Four 

The Wandmaker 

 

It was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant Harry knelt again beside 
Dumbledores body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he was 
staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrixs silver knife. Harrys 
voice was still saying, DobbyDobby even though he knew that the elf had gone 
where he could not call him back. 

 After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for 
here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he knelt over the elf. 
Hermione, he said suddenly. Where is she? 

Rons taken her inside, said Bill. Shell be all right. Harry looked back down at 
Dobby. He stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elfs body, then 
dragged off his own jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket. 

 The sea was rushing against the rock somewhere nearby; Harry listened to it 
while the others talked, discussing matters in which he could take no interest, making 
decisions, Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; 
now Bill was really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he gazed down at the 
tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if 
from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left 
behind at the Malfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harrys grief for Dobby 
seemed to diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a 
vast, silent ocean. 


 I want to do it properly, were the first words of which Harry was fully 
conscious of speaking. Not by magic. Have you got a spade? And shortly afterward he 
had set to work, alone, digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end 
of the garden, between bushes. He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, 
glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a 
gift to the elf who had saved their lives. 

 His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. 
He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing 
Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able 
to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could 
not penetrate Harry now while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort 
outthough Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love. 

 On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in 
sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his 
own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the 
Malfoys returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding 
blossomed in the darkness 

 The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. 
HallowsHorcruxesHallowsHorcruxesyet no longer burned with that weird, 
obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out. He felt as though he had been 
slapped awake again. 

 Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had 
been tonight, and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why 

 And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of 
mercyDumbledore had foreseen thatHow much more had he known? 

 Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had lightened a few 
degrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean. Hows Hermione? Better, said 
Ron. Fleurs looking after her. Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him 
why he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand, but he did not need it. 
They jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of their own and together they 
worked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough. 

 Harry wrapped the elf more snuggly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge of the 
grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed on the elfs bare feet. Dean 
produced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobbys head, muffling his 
batlike ears. We should close his eyes. 

 Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. Bill was wearing a 
traveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of 
what Harry recognized to be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing 
gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. 
Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleurs coats, crouched down and placed her fingers 
tenderly upon each of the elfs eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare. There, she 
said softly. Now he could be sleeping. 

 Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have 
been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced 
himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledores funeral, and the rows and 
rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of 


Dumbledores achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that 
Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a 
roughly dug hole. I think we ought to say something, piped up Luna. Ill go first, 
shall I? 

 And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the 
grave. Thank you so much Dobby for rescuing me from that cellar. Its so unfair that 
you had to die when you were so good and brave. Ill always remember what you did for 
us. I hope youre happy now. 

 She turned and looked expectingly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a 
thick voice, yeahthanks Dobby. Thanks, muttered Dean. Harry swallowed. 
Good bye Dobby, he said It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. 
Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell 
neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. Dya mind if I stay here a moment? He asked 
the others. 

 They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and 
then they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. 

 He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the 
sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, 
pillowlike, over the place where Dobbys head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for 
a wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now 
remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of 
someones hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and 
pointed it at the rock. 

 Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rocks 
surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more 
quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry 
stood up again, the stone read: HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF. 

 He looked at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, his scar 
still prickling a little, and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave, 
ideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible. 

 They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their 
attention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The room was light-colored, pretty, with a 
small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud 
upon the carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening. 

 lucky that Ginnys on holiday. If shed been at Hogwarts they could have 
taken her before we reached her. Now we know shes safe too. He looked around and 
saw Harry standing there. Ive been getting them all out of the Burrow, he explained. 
Moved them to Muriels. The Death Eaters know Rons with you now, theyre bound to 
target the family Cdont apologize, he added at the sight of Harrys expression. It was 
always a matter of time, Dads been saying so for months. Were the biggest blood 
traitor family there is. 

 How are they protected? asked Harry. Fidelius Charm. Dads Secret-Keeper. 
And weve done it on this cottage too; Im Secret-Keeper here. None of us can go to 
work, but thats hardly the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are 
well enough, well move them to Muriels too. There isnt much room here, but shes got 


plenty. Griphooks legs are on the mend. Fleurs given him Skele-Gro-we could 
probably move them in an hour or 

 No, Harry said and Bill looked startled. I need both of them here. I need to 
talk to them. Its important. He heard the authority of his own voice, the conviction, the 
voice of purpose that had come to him as he dug Dobbys grave. All of their faces were 
turned toward him looking puzzled. 

 Im going to wash, Harry told Bill looking down at his hands still covered with 
mud and Dobbys blood. Then Ill need to see them, straight away. He walked into the 
little kitchen, to the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking 
over the horizon, shell pink and faintly gold, as he washed, again following the train of 
thought that had come to him in the dark garden 

 Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry 
knew what he had seen. A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment, and 
then help had come. Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it. 

 Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window 
and to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room. He looked out over the ocean and 
felt closer, this dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all. 

 And still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was getting there too. 
Harry understood and yet did not understand. His instinct was telling him one thing, his 
brain quite another. The Dumbledore in Harrys head smiled, surveying Harry over the 
tips of his fingers, pressed together as if in prayer. 

 You gave Ron the DeluminatorYou understood himYou gave him a way 
back 

And you understood Wormtail tooYou knew there was a bit of regret there, 
somewhere 

And if you knew themWhat did you know about me, Dumbledore? 

Am I meant to know but not to seek? Did you know how hard Id feel that? Is 
that why you made it this difficult? So Id have time to work that out? 

 Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a bright gold ray of 
dazzling sun was rising over the horizon. Then he looked down at his clean hands and 
was momentarily surprised to see the cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and 
returned to the hall, and as he did so, he felt his scar pulse angrily, and then flashed 
across his mind, swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over water, the outline of a building 
he knew extremely well. 

 Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs. 

 I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander, Harry said. 

 No, said Fleur. You will ave to wait, Arry. Zey are both too tired C 

 Im sorry, he said without heat, but it cant wait. I need to talk to them now. 
Privately C and separately. Its urgent. 

 Harry, what the hells going on? asked Bill. You turn up here with a dead 
house-elf and a half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though shes been tortured, and 
Rons just refused to tell me anything C 

 We cant tell you what were doing, said Harry flatly. Youre in the Order, Bill, 
you know Dumbledore left us a mission. Were not supposed to talk about it to anyone 
else. 


 Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he was staring at 
Harry. His deeply scarred face was hard to read. Finally, Bill said, All right. Who do 
you want to talk to first? 

 Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly any time 
left; now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or Hallows? 

 Griphook, Harry said. Ill speak to Griphook first. 

 His heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous 
obstacle. 

 Up here, then, said Bill, leading the way. 

 Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back. 

 I need you two as well! he called to Ron and Hermione, who had been skulking, 
half concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room. 

 They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved. 

 How are you? Harry asked Hermione. You were amazing C coming up with 
that story when she was hurting you like that C 

 Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one-armed squeeze. 

 What are we doing now, Harry? he asked. 

 Youll see. Come on. 

 Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto a small landing. 
Three doors led off it. 

 In here, said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleurs room, it too had a view 
of the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to the window, turned his 
back on the spectacular view, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione 
took the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm. 

 Bill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down carefully upon the 
bed. Griphook grunted thanks, and Bill left, closing the door upon them all. 

 Im sorry to take you out of bed, said Harry. How are your legs? 

 Painful, replied the goblin. But mending. 

 He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange look: half 
truculent, half intrigued. Harry noted the goblins sallow skin, his long thin fingers, his 
black eyes. Fleur had removed his shoes: His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a 
house-elf, but not by much. His domed head was much bigger than a humans. 

 You probably dont remember C Harry began. 

 that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first time you ever 
visited Gringotts? said Griphook. I remember, Harry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you 
are very famous. 

 Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up. Harrys scar was 
still prickling. He wanted to get through this interview with Griphook quickly, and at the 
same time was afraid of making a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way to 
approach his request, the goblin broke the silence. 

 You buried the elf, he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous. I watched you 
from the window of the bedroom next door. 

 Yes, said Harry. 

 Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes. 

 You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter. 

 In what way? asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently. 


 You dug the grave. 

 So? 

 Griphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting 
like a Muggle, but it did not matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobbys grave 
or not. He gathered himself for the attack. 

 Griphook, I need to ask C 

 You also rescued a goblin. 

 What? 

 You brought me here. Saved me. 

 Well, I take it youre not sorry? said Harry a little impatiently. 

 No, Harry Potter, said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black 
beard upon his chin, but you are a very odd wizard. 

 Right, said Harry. Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to 
me. 

 The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at Harry as 
though he had never seen anything like him. 

 I need to break into a Gringotts vault. 

 Harry had not meant to say it so badly: the words were forced from him as pain 
shot through his lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts. He closed his 
mind firmly. He needed to deal with Griphook first. Ron and Hermione were staring at 
Harry as though he had gone mad. 

 Harry C said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook. 

 Break into a Gringotts vault? repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he shifted 
his position upon the bed. It is impossible. 

 No, it isnt, Ron contradicted him. Its been done. 

 Yeah, said Harry. The same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven 
years ago. 

 The vault in question was empty at the time, snapped the goblin, and Harry 
understood that even though Griphook had let Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of 
its defenses being breached. Its protection was minimal. 

 Well, the vault we need to get into isnt empty, and Im guessing its protection 
will be pretty powerful, said Harry. It belongs to the Lestranges. 

 He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would be time 
enough to explain after Griphook had given his answer. 

 You have no chance, said Griphook flatly. No chance at all. If you seek 
beneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours C 

 Thief, you have been warned, beware C yeah, I know, I remember, said Harry. 
But Im not trying to get myself any treasure, Im not trying to take anything for 
personal gain. Can you believe that? 

 The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harrys forehead 
prickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation. 

 If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal 
gain, said Griphook finally, it would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not 
used to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-
carriers. 


 Wand-carriers, repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar 
prickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry burned to question 
Ollivander next door. 

 The right to carry a wand, said the goblin quietly, has long been contested 
between wizards and goblins. 

 Well, goblins can do magic without wands, said Ron. 

 That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other 
magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers! 

 Well, goblins wont share any of their magic either, said Ron. You wont tell 
us how to make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a 
way wizards have never C 

 It doesnt matter, said Harry, noting Griphooks rising color. This isnt about 
wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature C 

 Griphook gave a nasty laugh. 

 But it is, it is precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, 
your race is set still more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, 
house-elves are slaughtered, and who amongst the wand-carriers protests? 

 We do! said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. We protest! 
And Im hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! Im a Mudblood! 

 Dont call yourself C Ron muttered. 

 Why shouldnt I? said Hermione. Mudblood, and proud of it! Ive got no 
higher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to 
torture, back at the Malfoys! 

 As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut 
Bellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat. 

 Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free? she asked. Did you know 
that weve wanted elves to be freed for years? (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm 
of Hermiones chair.) You cant want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, 
Griphook! 

 The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiousity he had shown Harry. 

 What do you seek within the Lestranges vault? he asked abruptly. The sword 
that lies inside it is a fake. This is the real one. He looked from one to the other of them. 
I think that you already know this. You asked me to lie for you back there. 

 But the fake sword isnt the only thing in that vault, is it? asked Harry. Perhaps 
youve seen other things in there? 

 His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his efforts to ignore the 
pulsing of his scar. 

 The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again. 

 It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians 
of fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our care, which were, so 
often, wrought by our fingers. 

 The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry to Hermione 
to Ron and then back again. 

 So young, he said finally, to be fighting so many. 

 Will you help us? said Harry. We havent got a hope of breaking in without a 
goblins help. Youre our one chance. 


 I shall . . . think about it, said Griphook maddeningly. 

 But C Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs. 

 Thank you, said Harry. 

 The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement, then flexed his 
short legs. 

 I think, he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleurs bed, that 
the Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me. . . . 

 Yeah, of course, said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and 
took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry 
thought he saw resentment in the goblins eyes as he closed the door upon him. 

 Little git, whispered Ron. Hes enjoying keeping us hanging. 

 Harry, whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from the door, into the 
middle of the still-dark landing, are you saying what I think youre saying? Are you 
saying theres a Horcrux in the Lestranges vault? 

 Yes, said Harry. Bellatrix was terrified when she thought wed been in there, 
she was beside herself. Why? What did she think wed seen, what else did she think we 
might have taken? Something she was petrified You-Know-Who would find out about. 

 But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Whos been, places hes 
done something important? said Ron, looking baffled. Was he ever inside the 
Lestranges vault? 

 I dont know whether he was ever inside Gringotts, said Harry. He never had 
gold there when he was younger, because nobody left him anything. He would have seen 
the bank from the outside, though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley. 

 Harrys scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and Hermione to 
understand about Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander. 

 I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault. I think 
hed have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world. And dont forget, 
he trusted Bellatrix and her husband. They were his most devoted servants before he fell, 
and they went looking for him after he vanished. He said it night he came back, I heard 
him. 

 Harry rubbed his scar. 

 I dont think hed have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though. He never told 
Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary. He probably told her it was a treasured 
possession and asked her to place it in her vault. The safest place in the world for 
anything you want to hide, Hagrid told me. . . except for Hogwarts. 

 When Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head. 

 You really understand him. 

 Bits of him, said Harry. Bits . . . I just wish Id understood Dumbledore as 
much. But well see. Come on C Ollivander now. 

 Ron and Hermione looked bewildered but very impressed as they followed him 
across the little landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleurs. A weak 
Come in! answered them. 

 The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. He had been 
held in the cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. 
He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. 
His great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the 


blanket could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron 
and Hermione. The rising sun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden 
and the freshly dug grave. 

 Mr. Ollivander, Im sorry to disturb you, Harry said. 

 My dear boy, Ollivanders voice was feeble. You rescued us, I thought we 
would die in that place, I can never thank you . . . never thank you . . . enough. 

 We were glad to do it. 

 Harrys scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was hardly any time 
left in which to beat Voldemort to his goal, or else to attempt to thwart him. He felt a 
flutter of panic . . . yet he had made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first. 
Feigning a calm he did not feel, he groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the 
two halves of his broken wand. 

 Mr. Ollivander, I need some help. 

 Anything. Anything. Said the wandmaker weakly. 

 Can you mend this? Is it possible? 

 Ollivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two barely connected 
halves in his palm. 

 Holly and phoenix feather, said Ollivander in a tremulous voice. Eleven inches. 
Nice and supple. 

 Yes, said Harry. Can you -- ? 

 No, whispered Ollivander. I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand that has suffered 
this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of. 

 Harry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless. He took the wand 
halves back and replaced them in the pouch around his neck. Ollivander stared at the 
place where the shattered wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had 
taken from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys. 

 Can you identify these? Harry asked. 

 The wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes, 
rolling it between his knobble-knuckled fingers, flexing it slightly. 

 Walnut and dragon heartstring, he said. Twelve-and-three-quarter inches. 
Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange. 

 And this one? 

 Ollivander performed the same examination. 

 Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was 
the wand of Draco Malfoy. 

 Was? repeated Harry. Isnt it still his? 

 Perhaps not. If you took it C 

 I did C  

 then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters. Much also 
depends upon the wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has been won, its 
allegiance will change. 

 There was a silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea. 

 You talk about wands like theyve got feelings, said Harry, like they can think 
for themselves. 

 The wand chooses the wizard, said Ollivander. That much has always been 
clear to those of us who have studied wandlore. 


 A person can still use a wand that hasnt chosen them, though? asked Harry. 

 Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic 
through almost any instrument. The best results, however, must always come where there 
is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An 
initial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning from the 
wizard, the wizard from the wand. 

 The sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful sound. 
I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force, said Harry. Can I use it safely? 

 I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand will 
usually bend its will to its new master. 

 So I should use this one? said Ron, pulling Wormtails wand out of his pocket 
and handing it to Ollivander. 

 Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches. Brittle. I was forced 
to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is 
more likely to do your bidding, and do it well, than another wand. 

 And this holds true for all wands, does it? asked Harry. 

 I think so, replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harrys face. You ask 
deep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic. 

 So, it isnt necessary to kill the previous owner to take the possession of a 
wand? asked Harry. 

 Ollivander swallowed. 

 Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill. 

 There are legends, though, said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened, the pain 
in his scar became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort has decided to put his idea 
into action. Legends about a wand C or wands C that have been passed from hand to 
hand by murder. 

 Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light gray, and his eyes 
were enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear. 

 Only one wand, I think, he whispered. 

 And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isnt he? asked Harry. 

 I C how? croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at Ron and Hermione 
for help. How do you know this? 

 He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands, 
said Harry. 

 Ollivander looked terrified. 

 He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I C I had no 
choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed! 

 I understand, said Harry. You told him about the twin cores? You said he just 
had to borrow another wizards wand? 

 Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew. He 
nodded slowly. 

 But it didnt work, Harry went on. Mine still beat the borrowed wand. Do you 
know why that is? 

 Ollivander shook his head slowly as he had just nodded. 


 I had . . . never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique 
that night. The connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet why your wand would 
have snapped the borrowed wand, I do not know. . . . 

We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder. 
When You-Know-Who realized my wand had done something strange, he came back and 
asked about that other wand, didnt he? 

How do you know this? 

 Harry did not answer. 

 Yes, he asked, whispered Ollivander. He wanted to know everything I could 
tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the 
Elder Wand. 

 Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flaggergasted. 

 The Dark Lord, said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, had always 
been happy with the wand I made him C yes and phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half 
inches. C until he discovered the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, 
more powerful wand, as the only way to conquer yours. 

 But hell know soon, if he doesnt already, that mines broken beyond repair, 
said Harry quietly. 

 No! said Hermione, sounding frightened. He cant know that, Harry, how 
could he --? 

Priori Incantatem, said Harry. We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at 
the Malfoys, Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them re-create the spells 
theyve cast lately, theyd see that yours broke mine, theyll see that you tried and failed 
to mend it, and theyll realize that Ive been using the blackthorn one ever since. 

The little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. Ron 
gave Harry a reproachful look, and said, Lets not worry about that now --- 

But Mr. Ollivander intervened. 

The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. 
Potter. He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly 
invulnerable. 

 And will it? 

 The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack, said Ollivander, but the 
idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit . . . formidable. 

 Harry was suddenly reminded of how unsure, when they first met, of how much 
he like Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the 
idea of the Dark Wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it 
repulsed him. 

 You C you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander? asked Hermione. 

 Oh yes, said Ollivander. Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wands course 
through history. There are gaps, of, course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, 
temporarily lost or hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying 
characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. There are written 
accounts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers have made it our business 
to study. They have the ring of authenticity. 

 So you C you dont think it can be a fairy tale or a myth? Hermione asked 
hopefully. 


 No, said Ollivander. Whether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. Its 
history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, 
and arouses such passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong 
hands, and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands. 

 Mr. Ollivander, said Harry, you told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had 
the Elder Wand, didnt you? 

 Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped. 

 But how C how do you -- ? 

 Never mind how I know it, said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar 
burned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, 
because it was so much farther north. You told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had 
the wand? 

 It was a rumor, whispered Ollivander. A rumor, years and years ago, long 
before you were born I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it 
would be for business; that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder 
Wand! 

 Yes, I can see that, said Harry. He stood up. Mr. Ollivander, one last thing, and 
then well let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows? 

 The C the what? asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered. 

 The Deathly Hallows. 

 Im afraid I dont know what youre talking about. Is this still something to do 
with wands? 

 Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting. He 
did not know about the Hallows. 

 Thank you, said Harry. Thank you very much. Well leave you to get some 
rest now. 

 Ollivander looked stricken. 

 He was torturing me! he gasped. The Cruciatus Curse . . . you have no 
idea. . . . 

 I do, said Harry, I really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all 
of this. 

 He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught glimpses of Bill, 
Fleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They 
all looked up at Harry as he appeared in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and 
continued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind him. The reddish mound of earth 
that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry walked back to it, as the pain in his head built 
more and more powerfully. It was a huge effort now to close down the visions that were 
forcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have to resist only a little longer. 
He would yield very soon, because he needed to know that his theory was right. He must 
make only one more short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione. 

 Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago, he said, I saw You-Know-
Who trying to find him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didnt 
have it anymore: It was stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out 
that Gregorovitch had it, I dont know C but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread 
the rumor, it cant have been that difficult. 


 Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts; Harry could see him standing there, and 
see too the lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, coming closer and closer. 

 And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful. And at the height of 
his power, when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he dueled 
Grindelwald and beat him, and he took the Elder Wand. 

 Dumbledore had the Elder Wand? said Ron. But then C where is it now? 

At Hogwarts, said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the cliff-top garden. 

 But then, lets go! said Ron urgently. Harry, lets go and get it before he 
does! 

 Its too late for that, said Harry. He could not help himself, but clutched his 
head, trying to help it resist. He knows where it is. Hes there now. 

 Harry! Ron said furiously. How long have you known this C why have we 
been wasting time? Why did you talk to Griphook first? We could have gone C we could 
still go C 

 No, said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. Hermiones right. 
Dumbledore didnt want me to have it. He didnt want me to take it. He wanted me to get 
the Horcruxes. 

 The unbeatable wand, Harry! moaned Ron. 

 Im not supposed to . . . Im supposed to get the Horcruxes. . . . 

 And now everything was cool and dark: The sun was barely visible over the 
horizon as he glided alongside Snape, up through the grounds toward the lake. 

 I shall join you in the castle shortly, he said in his high, cold voice. Leave me 
now. 

 Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billowing behind him. 
Harry walked slowly, waiting for Snapes figure to disappear. It would not do for Snape, 
or indeed anyone else, to see where he was going. But there were no lights in the castle 
windows, and he could conceal himself . . . and in a second he had cast upon himself a 
Disillusionment Charm that hid him even from his own eyes. 

 And he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the outlines of the 
beloved castle, his first kingdom, his birthright. . . . 

 And here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters. The white marble 
tomb, an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape. He felt again that rush of controlled 
euphoria, that heady sense of purpose in destruction. He raised the old yew wand: How 
fitting that this would be its last great act. 

 The tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure was as long as thin as 
it had been in life. He raised the wand again. 

 The wrappings fell open. The face was translucent, pale, sunken, yet almost 
perfectly preserved. They had left his spectacles on the crooked nose: He felt amused 
derision. Dumbledores hands were folded upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched 
beneath them, buried with him. 

 Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand? Had he 
thought that the Dark Lord would be scared to violate his tomb? The spiderlike hand 
swooped and pulled the wand from Dumbledores grasp, and as he took it, a shower of 
sparks flew from its tip, sparkling over the corpse of its last owner, ready to serve a new 
master at last. 

 


 

 

Chapter Twenty-Five 

Shell Cottage 

 

Bill and Fleur's cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea, its walls embedded 
with shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry went 
inside the tiny cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, 
like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. He spent much of the next few 
days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open 
sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face. 

The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still scared Harry. He 
could not remember, ever before, choosing /not/ to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that 
Ron could not help voicing whenever they were together. 

"What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?" "What 
if working out what the symbol meant made you 'worthy' to get the Hallows?" "Harry, if 
that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-
Who?" 

Harry had no answers: There were moments when he wondered whether it had been 
outright madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open the tomb. He could not 
even explain satisfactorily why he had decided against it: Every time he tried to 
reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded feebler to 
him. 

The odd thing was that Hermione's support made him feel just as confused as Ron's 
doubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real, she maintained that it was an 
evil object, and that the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to be 
considered. 

"You could never have done that, Harry," she said again and again. "You couldn't have 
broken into Dumbledore's grave." 

But the idea of Dumbledore's corpse frightened Harry much less than the possibility that 
he might have misunderstood the living Dumbledore's intentions. He felt that he was still 
groping in the dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering whether he 
had misread the signs, whether he should not have taken the other way. From time to time, 
anger at Dumbledore crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming 
themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained 
before he died. 

"But /is/ he dead?" said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the cottage. Harry had 
been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron 
and Hermione had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with 
their argument. 

"Yes, he is. Ron, /please" don't start that again!" 

"Look at the facts, Hermione," said Ron, speaking across Harry, who continued to gaze at 
the horizon. "The solve doe. The sword. The eye Harry saw in the mirror --" 


"Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don't you, Harry?" 

"I could have," said Harry without looking at her. 

"But you don't thing you did, do you?" asked Ron. 

"No, I don't," said Harry. 

"There you go!" said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry on. "If it wasn't 
Dumbledore, explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?" 

"I can't -- but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he's lying in a tomb at 
Hogwarts?" 

"I dunno, it could've been his ghost!" 

"Dumbledore wouldn't come back as a ghost," said Harry. There was little about 
Dumbledore he was sure of now, but he knew that much. "He would have gone on." 

"What d'you mean, 'gone on'?" asked Ron, but before Harry could say any more, a voice 
behind them said, "'Arry?" 

Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in the breeze. 

"'Arry, Grip'ook would like to speak to you. 'E eez in ze smallest bedroom, 'e says 'e does 
not want to be over'eard." 

Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear; she looked irritable 
as she walked back around the house. 

Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the cottage's three 
bedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept by night. He had drawn the red cotton 
curtains against the bright, cloudy sky, which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the 
rest of the airy, light cottage. 

"I have reached my decision, Harry Potter," said the goblin, who was sitting cross-legged 
in a low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly fingers. "Though the goblins of 
Gringotts will consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you --" 

"That's great!" said Harry, relief surging through him. "Griphook, thank you, we're really 
--" 

"-- in return," said the goblin firmly, "for payment." 

Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated. 

"How much do you want? I've got gold." 

"Not gold," said Griphook. "I have gold." 

His black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes. 

"I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor." 

Harry's spirits plummeted. 

"You can't have that," he said. "I'm sorry." 

"Then," said the goblin softly, "we have a problem." 

"We can give you something else," said Ron eagerly. "I'll bet the Lestranges have got 
loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault." 

He had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily. 

"I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right!" 

"The sword's ours --" 

"it is not," said the goblin. 

"We're Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor's --" 

"And before it was Gryffindor's, whose was it?" demanded the goblin, sitting up straight. 

"No one's," said Ron. "It was made for him, wasn't it?" 


"No!" cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at Ron. 
"Wizarding arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk the First's, taken from him by 
Godric Gryffindor! It is a _____ _________, a masterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs 
with the gobl___. The sword is the price of my hire, take it or leave it!" 

Griphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other ____, then said, "We need to discuss 
this, Griphook, if that's all right. Could you give us a few minutes?" 

The goblin nodded, looking sour. 

Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fireplace, brow furrowed, 
trying to think what to do. Behind him, Ron said, "He's having a laugh. We can't let him 
have that sword." 

"It is true?" Harry asked Hermione. "Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor?" 

"I don't know," she said hopelessly. "Wizarding history often skates over what the 
wizards have done to other magical races, but there's no account that I know of that says 
Gryffindor stole the sword." 

"It'll be one of those goblin stories," said Ron, "about how the wizards are always trying 
to get one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn't asked for 
one of our wands." 

"Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron." said Hermione. "They've been 
treated brutally in the past." 

"Goblins aren't exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?" said Ron. "They've killed 
plenty of us. They've fought dirty too." 

"But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isn't 
going to make him more likely to help us, is it?" 

There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem. Harry looked 
out of the window at Dobby's grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside 
the headstone. 

"Okay," said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, "how's this? We tell Griphook we 
need the sword until we get inside the _____ and then he can have it. There's a fake in 
these, isn't there? We switch them, and give him the fake." 

"Ron, he'd know the difference better than we would!" said Hermione. "He's the only one 
who realized there had been a swap!" 

"Yeah, but we could _ca_per before he realizes --" 

He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him. 

"That," she said quietly, "is despicable. Ask for his help, then double-cross him? And you 
wonder why goblins don't like wizards, Ron?" 

Ron's ears had turned red. 

"All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What's your solution, then?" 

"We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable." 

"Brilliant, I'll go and get one of our ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap 
it." 

Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but 
the sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their 
one, indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes. 

He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea. The idea that 
Gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him: He had always been 


proud to be a Gryffindor; Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard 
who had clashed with the pureblood-loving Slytherin.... 

"Maybe he's lying," Harry said, opening his eyes again. "Griphook. Maybe Gryffindor 
didn't take the sword. How do we know the goblin version of history's right?" 

"Does it make a difference?" asked Hermione. 

"Changes how I feel about it," said Harry. 

He took a deep breath. 

"We'll tell him he can have the sword after he's helped us get into that vault -- but we'll be 
careful to avoid telling him exactly /when/ he can have it." 

A grin spread slowly across Ron's face. Hermione, however, looked alarmed. 

"Harry, we can't --" 

"He can have it," Harry went on, "after we've used it on all of the Horcruxes. I'll make 
sure he gets it then. I'll keep my word." 

"But that could be years!" said Hermione. 

"I know that, but /he/ needn't. I won't be lying... really." 

Harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He remembered the words that 
had been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard: FOR THE GREATER GOOD. He 
pushed the idea away. What choice did they have? 

"I don't like it," said Hermione. 

"Nor do I, much," Harry admitted. 

"Well, I think it's genius," said Ron, standing up again. "Let's go and tell him." 

Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give 
any definite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he 
was speaking; he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, 
Griphook had eyes for nobody but Harry. 

"I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help 
you?" 

"Yes," said Harry. 

"Then shake," said the goblin, holding out his hand. 

Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in 
his own. Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together, and said, "So. We 
begin!" 

It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again. They settled to work in the 
smallest bedroom, which was kept, according to Griphook's preference, in semidarkness. 

"I have visited the Lestranges' vault only once," Griphook told them, "on the occasion I 
was told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The 
oldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are 
largest and best protected...." 

They remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time. Slowly the days 
stretched into weeks. There was problem after problem to overcome, not least of which 
was that their store of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted. 

"There's really only enough left for one of us," said Hermione, tilting the thick mudlike 
potion against the lamplight. 

"That'll be enough," said Harry, who was examining Griphook's hand-drawn map of the 
deepest passageways. 


The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was 
going on now that Harry, Ron and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked 
questions, although Harry often felt Bill's eyes on the three of them at the table, 
thoughtful, concerned. 

The longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did not much like the 
goblin. Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser 
creatures and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to 
reach the Lestranges' vault. Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, 
but they did not discuss it. They needed Griphook. 

The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he 
continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill 
(following an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement 
could not continue. Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although 
he refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and 
various fungi. 

Harry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell 
Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole Weasley family had been 
driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work. 

"I'm sorry," he told Fleur, one blustery April evening as he helped her prepare dinner. "I 
never meant you to have to deal with all of this." 

She had just set some knives to work, chipping up steaks for Griphook and Bill, who had 
preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by Greyback. While the knives 
sliced behind her, her somewhat irritable expression softened. 

"'Arry, you saved my sister's life, I do not forget." 

This was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against reminding her that 
Gabrielle had never been in real danger. 

"Anyway," Fleur went on, pointing her want at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began 
to bubble at once, "Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel's zis evening. Zat will make zings 
easier. Ze goblin," she scowled a little at the mention of him, "can move downstairs, and 
you, Ron, and Dean can take zat room." 

"We don't mind sleeping in the living room," said Harry, who knew that Griphook would 
thing poorly of having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to 
their plans. "Don't worry about us." And when she tried to protest he went on, "We'll be 
off your hands soon too, Ron, Hermione, and I. We won't need to be here much longer." 

"But, what do you mean?" she said, frowning at him, her wand pointing at the casserole 
dish now suspended in midair. "Of course you must not leave, you are safe 'ere!" 

She looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, and he was glad that the back door 
opened at that moment. Luna and Dean entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and 
their arms full of driftwood. 

"... and tiny little ears," Luna was saying, "a bit like hippo's, Daddy says, only purple and 
hairy. And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too 
fast...." 

Looking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed, following Luna into the 
combined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were laying the dinner table. 
Seizing the chance to escape Fleur's questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice 
and followed them. 


"... and if you ever come to our house I'll be able to show you the horn, Daddy wrote to 
me about it but I haven't seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts 
Express and I never got home for Christmas," Luna was saying, as she and Dean relit the 
fire. 

"Luna, we told you," Hermione called over to her. "That horn exploded. It came from an 
Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack --" 

"No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn," said Luna serenely, "Daddy told me. It will 
probably have re-formed by now, they mend themselves, you know." 

Hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as Bill appeared, leading Mr. 
Ollivander down the stairs. The wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung 
to Bill's arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase. 

"I'm going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander," said Luna, approaching the old man. 

"And I you, my dear," said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. 

"You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place." 

"So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander," said Fleur, kissing him on both cheeks. "And I wonder 
whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill's Auntie Murie!? I never 
returned 'er tiara." 

"It will be an honor," said Ollivander with a little bow, "the very least I can do in return 
for your generous hospitality." 

Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wandmaker. The tiara 
sat glittering and twinkling in the light from the low-hanging lamp. 

"Moonstones and diamonds," said Griphook, who had sidled into the room without Harry 
noticing. "Made by goblins, I think?" 

"And paid for by wizards," said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both 
furtive and challenging. 

A strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and Ollivander set off into the 
night. The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely 
enough room to move, they started to eat. The fire crackled and popped in the grate 
beside them. Fleur, Harry noticed, was merely playing with her food; she glanced at the 
window every few minutes; however, Bill returned before they had finished their first 
course, his long hair tangled by the wind. 

"Everything's fine," he told Fleur. "Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny 
sends you all her love, Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they're still 
operating an Owl-Order business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara 
back, though. She said she thought we'd stolen it." 

"Ah, she eez charmant, your aunt," said Fleur crossly, waving her wand and causing the 
dirty plates to rise and form a stack in midair. She caught them and marched out of the 
room. 

"Daddy's made a tiara," piped up Luna, "Well, more of a crown, really." 

Ron caught Harry's eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous 
headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius. 

"Yes, he's trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks he's identified most 
of the main elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made a difference --" 

There was a bang on the front door. Everyone's head turned toward it. Fleur came 
running out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feed, his wand pointing 


at the door; Harry, Ron, and Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped beneath 
the table, out of sight. 

"Who is it?" Bill called. 

"It is I, Remus John Lupin!" called a voice over the howling wind. Harry experienced a 
thrill of fear; what had happened? "I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and 
you, the Secret-Keeper of Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me come in an 
emergency!" 

"Lupin," muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open. 

Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in a traveling cloak, his 
graying hair windswept. He straightened up, looked around the room, making sure of 
who was there, then cried aloud, "It's a boy! We've named him Ted, after Dora's father!" 

Hermione shrieked. 

"Wha --? Tonks -- Tonks has had the baby?" 

"Yes, yes, she's had the baby!" shouted Lupin. All around the table came cries of delight, 
sighs of relief: Hermione and Fleur both squealed, "Congratulations!" and Ron said, 
"Blimey, a baby!" as if he had never heard of such a thing before. 

"Yes -- yes -- a boy," said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own happiness. He 
strode around the table and hugged Harry; the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place 
might never have happened. 

"You'll be godfather?" he said as he released Harry. 

"M-me?" stammered Harry. 

"You, yes, of course -- Dora quite agrees, no one better --" 

"I -- yeah -- blimey --" 

Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and 
Fleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink. 

"I can't stay long, I must get back," said Lupin, beaming around at them all: He looked 
years younger than Harry had ever seen him. "Thank you, thank you, Bill" 

Bill had soon filled all of their goblets, they stood and raised them high in a toast. 

"To Teddy Remus Lupin," said Lupin, "a great wizard in the making!" 

"'Oo does 'e look like?" Fleur inquired. 

"I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair. It looked black 
when he was born, but I swear it's turned ginger in the hour since. Probably blond by the 
time I get back. Andromeda says Tonks's hair started changing color the day that she was 
born." He drained his goblet. "Oh, go on then, just one more," he added, beaming, as Bill 
made to fill it again. 

The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and Bill was soon 
opening another bottle of wine. Lupin's news seemed to have taken them out of 
themselves, removed them for a while from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were 
exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and 
after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone. Harry thought he was 
the only one who had noticed this, until he saw Bill's eyes following the goblin up the 
stairs. 

"No... no... I really must get back," said Lupin at last, declining yet another goblet of 
wine. He got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself. 

"Good-bye, good-bye -- I'll try and bring some pictures in a few day's time -- they'll all be 
so glad to know that I've seen you --" 


He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and grasping hands 
with the men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night. 

"Godfather, Harry!" said Bill as they walked into the kitchen together, helping clear the 
table. "A real honor! Congratulations!" 

As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled the door behind him 
closed, shutting out the still-voluble voices of the others, who were continuing to 
celebrate even in Lupin's absence. 

"I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn't been easy to get an opportunity with 
the cottage this full of people." 

Bill hesitated. 

"Harry, you're planning something with Griphook." 

It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it. He merely looked 
at Bill, waiting. 

"I know goblins," said Bill. "I've worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts. As far 
as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin friends -- or, at 
least, goblins I know well, and like." Again, Bill hesitated. 

"Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised him in return?" 

"I can't tell you that," said Harry. "Sorry, Bill." 

The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring through more empty 
goblets. 

"Wait," Bill told her, "Just a moment." 

She backed out and he closed the door again. 

"Then I have to say this," Bill went on. "If you have struck any kind of bargain with 
Griphook, and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be 
exceptionally careful. Goblin notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the 
same as human ones." 

Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him. 

"What do you mean?" he asked. 

"We are talking about a different breed of being," said Bill. "Dealings between wizards 
and goblins have been fraught for centuries -- but you'll know all that from History of 
Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been 
innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are 
perhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, 
that they have no respect for goblin ownership." 

"I respect --" Harry began, but Bill shook his head. 

"You don't understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with 
goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the 
purchaser. All goblin made objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs." 

"But it was bought --" 

"-- then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. They have, 
however, great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to 
wizard. You saw Griphook's face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I 
believe he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the 
goblins once the original purchaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made 
objects, passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more than 
theft." 


Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed more than he was 
letting on. 

"All I am saying," said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, "is to 
be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into 
Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin." 

"Right," said Harry as Bill opened the door, "yeah. Thanks. I'll bear that in mind." 

As he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him, born no doubt of the 
wine he had drunk. He seemed set on ______ to become just as reckless a godfather to 
Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to him. 

 

Chapter Twenty-Six 

Gringotts 

 Their plans were made, their preparations complete; in the smallest bedroom a 
single long, coarse black hair (plucked from the sweater Hermione had been wearing at 
Malfoy Manor) lay curled in a small glass phial on the mantelpiece. 

 "And you'll be using her actual wand," said Harry, nodding toward the walnut 
wand, "so I reckon you'll be pretty convincing." 

 Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bit her as she picked it 
up. 

 "I hate that thing," she said in a low voice. "I really hate it. It feels all wrong, it 
doesn't work properly for me . . . It's like a bit of her." 

 Harry could not help but remember how Hermione has dismissed his loathing of 
the blackthorn wand, insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well 
as his own, telling him to simply practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back to 
her, however, the eve of their attempted assault on Gringotts felt like the wrong moment 
to antagonize her. 

 "It'll probably help you get in character, though," said Ron. "think what that 
wand's done!" 

 "But that's my point!" said Hermione. "This is the wand that tortured Neville's 
mum and dad, and who knows how many other people? This is the wand that killed 
Sirius!" 

 Harry had not thought of that: He looked down at the wand and was visited by a 
brutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with Gryffindor's sword, which was propped 
against the wall beside him. 

 "I miss my wand," Hermione said miserably. "I wish Mr. Ollivander could have 
made me another one too." 

 Mr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning. She was out on the back 
lawn at that moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun. Dean, who had lost 
his wand to the Snatchers, was watching rather gloomily. 

 Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco 
Malfoy. He had been surprised, but pleased to discover that it worked for him at least as 
well as Hermione's had done. Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret 


workings of wands, Harry thought he knew what Hermione's problem was: She had not 
won the walnut wand's allegiance by taking it personally from Bellatrix. 

 The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry reached 
instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his action at 
once. He could tell that the goblin had noticed. Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, 
he said, "We've just been checking the last-minute stuff, Griphook. We've told Bill and 
Fleur we're leaving tomorrow, and we've told them not to get up to see us off." 

 They had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need to transform in 
Bellatrix before they left, and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected about what 
they were about to do, the better. They had also explained that they would not be 
returning. As they had lost Perkin's old tent on the night that the Snatcher's caught them, 
Bill had lent them another one. It was now packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry 
was impressed to learn, Hermione had protected from the Snatchers by the simple 
expedient of stuffing it down her sock. 

 Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to mention the home 
comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks, Harry was looking forward to 
escaping the confinement of Shell Cottage. He was tired of trying to make sure that they 
were not overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark bedroom. Most of all, he longed 
to be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how and when they were to part from the 
goblin without handing over Gryffindor's sword remained a question to which Harry had 
no answer. It had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it, because the 
goblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more than five minutes at 
a time: "He could give my mother lessons," growled Ron, as the goblin's long fingers 
kept appearing around the edges of doors. With Bill's warning in mind, Harry could not 
help suspecting that Griphook was on the watch for possible skullduggery. Hermione 
disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that Harry had given up attempting to 
pick her brains on how best to do it: Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to 
snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better than "We'll just 
have to wing it, mate." 

 Harry slept badly that night. Lying away in the early hours, he thought back to the 
way he had felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and 
remembered a determination, almost an excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of 
anxiety nagging doubts: He could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong. 
He kept telling himself that their plan was good, that Griphook knew what they were 
facing, that they were well-prepared for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter, 
yet still he felt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was sure that he too was 
awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so Harry did not speak. 

 It was a relief when six o-clock arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping 
bags, dress in the semidarkness, then creep out into the garden, where they were to meet 
Hermione and Griphook. The dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was 
May. Harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to 
the sea washing backward and forward against the cliff: He was going to miss the sound. 

 Small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of Dobby's 
grave now, in a year's time the mound would be covered in flowers. The white stone that 
bore the elf's name had already acquired a weathered look. He realized now that they 
could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with 


sadness to think of leaving him behind. Looking down on the grave, he wondered yet 
again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them. His fingers moved 
absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck, thorough which he could 
feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen Dumbledore's eye. 
Then the sound of a door opening made him look around. 

 Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them, accompanied by 
Griphook. As she walked, she was tucking the small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of 
another set of the old robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew 
perfectly well that it was really Hermione, he could not suppress a shiver of loathing. She 
was taller than he was, her long black hair rippling down her back, her heavily lidded 
eyes disdainful as they rested upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard Hermione 
through Bellatrix's low voice. 

 "She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron, come here so I can do 
you . . ." 

 "right, but remember, I don't like the beard too long" 

 "Oh, for heaven's sake, this isn't about looking handsome" 

 "It's not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the 
way you did last time." 

 Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she transformed 
various aspects of Ron's appearance. He was to be given a completely fake identity, and 
they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile 
Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility Cloak. 

 "There," said Hermione, "how does he look, Harry?" 

 It was just not possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought 
because he knew him so well. Ron's hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown 
beard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows. 

 "Well, he's not my type, but he'll do," said Harry. "Shall we go, then?" 

 All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and silent under the 
fading stars, then turned and began to walk toward the point, just beyond the boundary 
wall, where the Fidelius Chard stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. 
Once past the gate, Griphook spoke. 

 "I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?" 

 Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his hands linked on 
front of Harry's throat. He was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and 
the surprising strength with which he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak 
out of the beaded bag and threw it over them both. 

 "Perfect," she said, bending down to check Harry's feet. "I can't see a thing. Let's 
go." 

 Harry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his shoulders, concentrating with all 
his might on the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to Diagon Alley. The 
goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later 
Harry's feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles 
bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning, quite unconscious of the 
little inn's existence. 

 The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Ton, the stooped and 
toothless landlord, was polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of warlocks 


having a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into 
the shadows. 

 "Madam Lestrange," murmured Tom, and as Hermione paused he inclined his 
head subserviently. 

 "Good morning," said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying Griphook 
piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised. 

 "Too polite," Harry whispered in Hermione's ear as they passed out of the Inn into 
the tiny backyard. "You need to treat people like they're scum!" 

 "Okay, okay!" 

 Hermione drew out Bellatrix's wand and rapped a brick in the nondescript wall in 
front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole appeared in the middle 
of them, which grew wider and wider, finally forming an archway onto the narrow 
cobbled street that was Diagon Alley. 

 It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly and 
shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling 
place Harry had visited before his first team at Hogwarts so many years before. More 
shops than ever were boarded up, though several new establishments dedicated to the 
Dark Arts had been created since his last visit. Harry's own face glared down at him from 
posters plastered over many windows, always captioned with the words UNDESIRABLE 
NUMBER ONE. 

 A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard them moaning to 
the few passersby, pleading for gold, insisting that they were really wizards. One man 
had a bloody bandage over his eye. 

 As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. they seemed to 
melt away before her, drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could. 
Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came 
staggering right across her path. 

 "My children," he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-pitched, 
he sounded distraught. "Where are my children? What has he done with them? You know, 
you know!" 

 "I--I really--" stammered Hermione. 

 The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat. Then, with a bang and a burst of 
red light he was thrown backward onto the ground, unconscious. Ron stood there, his 
wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at the 
windows on either side of the street, while a little knot of prosperous-looking passerby 
gathered their robes about them and broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene. 

 their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more conspicuous; for a 
moment Harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a 
different plan. Before they could move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry 
from behind them. 

 "Why, Madam Lestrange!" 

 Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around Harry's neck: A tall, 
think wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was striding toward 
them. 


 "It's Travers," hissed the goblin into Harry's ear, but at that moment Harry could 
not think who Travers was. Hermione had drawn herself up to full height and said with as 
much contempt as she could muster: 

 "And what do you want?" 

 Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted. 

 "He's another Death Eater!" breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled sideways to 
repeat the information into Hermione's ear. 

 "I merely sought to greet you," said Travers coolly, "but if my presence is not 
welcome . . ." 

 Harry recognized his voice now: Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had 
been summoned to Xenophiliuss house. 

 "No, no, not at all, Travers," said Hermione quickly, trying to cover up her 
mistake. "How are you?" 

 "Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about, Bellatrix." 

 "Really? Why?" asked Hermione. 

 "Well," Travers coughed, "I heard that the Inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were 
confined to the house, after the . . . ah . . . escape." 

 Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was true, and Bellatrix was not 
supposed to be out in public-- 

 "The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past," 
said Hermione in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrix's most contemptuous manner. 
"Perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is, Travers." 

 Though the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less suspicious. He 
glanced down at the man Ron had just Stunned. 

 "How did it offend you?" 

 "It does not matter, it will not do so again," said Hermione coolly. 

 "Some of these wandless can be troublesome," said Travers. "While they do 
nothing but beg I have no objection, but one of them actually asked me to plead her case 
in the Ministry last week. 'I'm a witch, sir, I'm a witch, let me prove it to you!" he said in 
a squeaky impersonation. "As if I was going to give her my wand--but whose wand," said 
Travers curiously, "are you using at the moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own was--" 

 "I have my wand here," said Hermione coldly, holding up Bellatrix's wand. "I 
don't know what rumors you have been listening to, Travers, but you seem sadly 
misinformed." 

 Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead to Ron. 

 "Who is your friend? I do not recognize him." 

 "This is Dragomir Despard," said Hermione; they had decided that a fictional 
foreigner was the safest cover for Ron to assume. "He speaks very little English, but he is 
in sympathy with the Dark Lord's aims. He has traveled here from Transylvania to see 
our new regime." 

 "Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?" 

 "'Ow you?" said Ron, holding out his hand. 

 Travers extended two fingers and shook Ron's hand as though frightened of 
dirtying himself. 

 So what brings you and your--ah--sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley this early?" 
asked Travers. 


 "I need to visit Gringotts," said Hermione. 

 "Alas, I also," said Travers. "Gold, filthy gold! We cannot live without it, yet I 
confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends." 

 Harry felt Griphook's clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck. 

 "Shall we?" said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward. 

 Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the 
crooked, cobbled street toward the place where the snowy-white Gringotts stood towering 
over the other little shops. Ron sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook 
followed. 

 A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it 
was, with Travers matching at what he believed to be Bellatrix's side, there was no means 
for Harry to communicate with Hermione or Ron. All too soon they arrived at the foot of 
the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook had already warned 
them, the liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two 
wizards, both of whom were clutching long thin golden rods. 

 "Ah, Probity Probes," signed Travers theatrically, "so crude--but so effective!" 

 And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the 
golden rods and passed them up and down his body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected 
spells of concealment and hidden magical objects. Knowing that he had only seconds, 
Harry pointed Draco's wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured, "Confundo" 
twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, 
each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them. 

 Hermione's long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps. 

 "One moment, madam," said the guard, raising his Probe. 

 "But you've just done that!" said Hermione in Bellatrix's commanding, arrogant 
voice. Travers looked around, eyebrows raised. The guard was confused. He stared down 
at the thin golden Probe and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, 

 "Yeah, you've just checked them, Marius." 

 Hermione swept forward. Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly 
behind them. Harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold. The wizards were both 
scratching their heads. 

 Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver and which 
carried the poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves. Harry looked up at it, 
and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came to him: standing on this very spot on the 
day that he had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of his life, and Hagrid 
standing beside him saying, "Like I said, yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it." Gringotts had 
seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had 
never known he possessed, and never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would 
return to steal . . . But within seconds they were standing in the vast marble hall of the 
bank. 

 The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools serving the first 
customers of the day. Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was 
examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step 
ahead of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to Ron. 


 The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in particular, 
"Leprechaun," and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was 
examined and given back to him. 

 Hermione stepped forward. 

 "Madam Lestrange!" said the goblin, evidently startled. "Dear me!" How--how 
may I help you today?" 

 "I wish to enter my vault," said Hermione. 

 The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around. Not only was 
Travers hanging back, watching, but several other goblins had looked up from their work 
to stare at Hermione. 

 "You have . . . identification?" asked the goblin. 

 "Identification? I--I have never been asked for identification before!" said 
Hermione. 

 "They know!" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, "They must have been warned 
there might be an imposter!" 

 "Your wand will do, madam," said the goblin. He held out a slightly trembling 
hand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were 
aware that Bellatrix's wand had been stolen. 

 "Act now, act now," whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, "the Imperious Curse!" 

 Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old goblin, 
and whispered, for the first time in his life, "Imperio!" 

 A curious sensation shot down Harry's arm, a feeling of tingling, warmth that 
seemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand 
and the curse it had just cast. The goblin took Bellatrix's wand, examined it closely, and 
then said, "Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!" 

 "What?" said Hermione, "No, no, that's mine--" 

 "A new wand?" said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all 
around were watching. "But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?" 

 Harry acted without thinking. Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, 
"Imperio!" once more. 

 "Oh yes, I see," said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix's wand, "yes, very 
handsome. and is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don't 
you?" 

 Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry's enormous relief she accepted 
the bizarre turn of events without comment. 

 The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin 
approached. 

 "I shall need the Clankers," he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a 
moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed 
to his senior. "Good, good! S, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange," said the old 
goblin, hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight. "I shall take you to your 
vault." 

 He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily toward them, the 
contents of the leather bag still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with his 
mouth hanging wide open. Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by 
regarding Travers with confusion. 


 Wait C Bogrod! 

 Another goblin came scurrying around the counter. 

 We have instructions, he said with a bow to Hermione. Forgive me, Madam, 
but there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange. 

 He whispered urgently in Bogrods ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off. 

 I am aware of the instructions, Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault  
Very old family  old clients  This way, please   

 And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall. 
Harry looked back at Travers , who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, 
and made his decision. With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them, 
walking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone 
passageway beyond, which was lit with flaming torches. 

 Were in trouble; they suspect, said Harry as the door slammed behind them 
and he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his shoulders: 
neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of 
Harry Potter in their midst. Theyre Imperiused, he added, in response to Hermione and 
Rons confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there 
looking blank. I dont think I did it strongly enough, I dont know  

 And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange 
shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: You need to mean 
them, Potter! 

 What do we do? asked Ron. Shall we get out now, while we can? 

 If we can, said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main hall, 
beyond which who knew what was happening. 

 Weve got this far, I say we go on, said Harry. 

 Good! said Griphook. So, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no long have 
the authority. But there will not be room for the wizard. 

 Harry pointed his wand at Travers. 

 Imperio! 

 The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace. 

 What are you making him do? 

 Hide, said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a 
little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was 
sure he could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, 
Bogrod in front of Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione crammed together in the back. 

 With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurried past Travers, who 
was wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through 
the labyrinthine passages, sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything 
over the rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair flew behind him as they swerved 
between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back. They 
might as well have left enormous footprints behind them; the more he thought about it, 
the more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, to have brought 
along Bellatrixs wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it C 

 There were a deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a 
hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding 
over the track. Harry heard Griphook shout, No! but there was no braking. They 


zoomed through it. Water filled Harrys eyes and mouth: He could not see or breathe: 
Then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry 
heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek 
something, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing 
painlessly on the rocky passage floor. 

 C-Cushioning Charm, Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her to her feet, but to 
Harrys horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood there in 
overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless 
again. They were realizing it as they looked at each other, feeling their own faces. 

 The Thiefs Downfall! said Griphook, clambering to his feet and looking back 
the deluge onto the tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been more than water. It washes 
away all enchantment, all magical concealment! They know there are imposers in 
Gringotts, they have set off defenses against us! 

 Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag, and hurriedly 
thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he had not lost the Invisibility Cloak. 
Then he turned to see Bogrod shaking his head in bewilderment: The Thiefs Downfall 
seemed to have lifted his Imperius Curse. 

 We need him, said Griphook, we cannot enter the vault without a Gringotts 
goblin. And we need the clankers! 

 Imperio! Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt 
again the sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand. Bogrod submitted once 
more to his will, his befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as Ron 
hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools. 

 Harry, I think I can hear people coming! said Hermione, and she pointed 
Bellatrixs wand at the waterfall and cried, Protego! They saw the Shield Charm break 
the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway. 

 Good thinking, said Harry. Lead the way, Griphook! 

 How are we going to get out again? Ron asked as they hurried on foot into the 
darkness after the goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog. 

 Lets worry about that when we have to, said Harry. He was trying to listen: He 
thought he could hear something clanking and moving around nearby. Griphook, how 
much farther? 

 Not far, Harry Potter, not far   

 And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had been prepared, 
but which still brought all of them to a halt. 

 A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring access to 
four or five of the deepest vaults in the place. The beasts scales had turned pale and flaky 
during its long incarceration under the ground, its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs 
bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky 
floor. Its great spiked wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the chamber if it 
spread them, and when it turned its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that 
made the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a jet of fire that sent them running 
back up the passageway. 

 It is partially blind, panted Griphook, but even more savage for that. However, 
we have the means to control it. It has learned what to expect when the Clankers come. 
Give them to me. 


 Ron passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin pulled out a number of small 
metal instruments that when shaken made a long ringing noise like miniature hammers on 
anvils. Griphook handed them out: Bogrod accepted his meekly. 

 You know what to do, Griphook told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. It will expect 
pain when it hears the noise. It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm upon the 
door of the vault. 

 They advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers, and the noise 
echoed off the rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that the inside of Harrys skull seemed 
to vibrate with the den. The dragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry 
could see it trembling, and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes 
across its face, and guess that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the 
sound of the Clankers. 

 Make him press his hand to the door! Griphook urged Harry, who turned his 
wand again upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the wood, and the 
door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling 
with golden coins and goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures C some with 
long spines, other with drooping wings C potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still 
wearing a crown. Search, fast! said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault. He had 
described Hufflepuffs cap to Ron and Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown 
Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did not know what it looked like. He barely had 
time to glance around, however, before there was a muffled clunk from behind them: The 
door had reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they were plunged into total 
darkness. 

 No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us! said Griphook as Ron gave a 
shout of surprise. Light your wands, cant you? And hurry, we have little time! 

 Lumos! 

 Harry shone his lit wand around the vault: Its beam fell upon glittering jewels; he 
saw the fake sword of Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron 
and Hermione had lit their wands too, and were now examining the piles of objects 
surrounding them. 

 Harry, could this be -- ? Aargh! 

 Hermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his wand on her in time to see a 
jeweled goblet tumbling from her grip. But as it fell, it split, became a shower of goblets, 
so that a second later, with a great clatter, the floor was covered in identical cups rolling 
in every direction, the original impossible to discern amongst them. 

 It burned me! moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers. 

 They have added Germino and Flagrante Curses! said Griphook. 

 Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless C and 
if you continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the 
weight of expanding gold! 

 Okay, dont touch anything! said Harry desperately, but even as he said it, Ron 
accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot, and twenty more exploded 
into being while Ron hopped on the spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with 
the hot metal. 

 Stand still, dont move! said Hermione, clutching at Ron. 


 Just look around! said Harry. Remember, the cups small and gold, its got a 
badger engraved on it, two handles C otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaws symbol 
anywhere, the eagle C 

 They directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously on the 
spot. It was impossible not to brush up against anything; Harry sent a great cascade of 
fake Galleons onto the ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely 
room to place their feet, and the glowing gold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a 
furnace. Harrys wandlight passed over shields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves 
rising to the ceiling; higher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly it found an 
object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble. 

 Its there, its up there! 

 Ron and Hermione pointed there wands at it too, so that the little golden cup 
sparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which 
had passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom 
Riddle. 

 And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything? asked 
Ron. 

 Accio Cup! cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her desperation 
what Griphook had told them during their planning sessions. 

 No use, no use! snarled the goblin. 

 Then what do we do? said Harry, glaring at the goblin. If you want the sword, 
Griphook, then youll have to help us more than C wait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? 
Hermione, give it here! 

 Hermione fumbled insider her robes, drew out a beaded bag, rummaged for a few 
seconds, then removed the shining sword. Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched 
the tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby, which did not multiply. 

 If I can just poke the sword through a handle C but how am I going to get up 
there? 

 The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them, even Ron, 
who was tallest. The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down 
Harrys face and back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard 
the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing 
louder and louder. 

 They were truly trapped now: There was no way out except through the door, and 
a horde of goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and 
Hermione and saw terror in their faces. 

 Hermione, said Harry, as the clanking grew louder, Ive got to get up there, 
weve got to get rid of it C 

 She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, Levicorpus. 

 Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of 
it like white-hot bodies, filling the cramped space. With screams of pain, Ron, Hermione, 
and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate. 
Half buried in a rising tide of red-hot treasure, they struggled and yelled has Harry thrust 
the sword through the handle of Hufflepuffs cup, hooking it onto the blade. 

 Impervius! screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, Ron, and the 
goblins from the burning metal. 


 Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down: Ron and Hermione were waist 
deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but 
Griphook had sunk out of sight; and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in 
view. 

 Harry seized Griphooks fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin emerged by 
degrees, howling. 

 Liberatocorpus! yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the 
surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of Harrys hand. 

 Get it! Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin, as Griphook 
clambered onto his shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot 
objects. Wheres the sword? It had the cup on it! 

 The clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafening C it was too late 
C 

 There! 

 It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged, and in that instant 
Harry knew that the goblin had never expected them to keep their word. One hand 
holding tightly to a fistful of Harrys hair, to make sure he did not fall into the heaving 
sea of burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out of 
Harrys reach. The tiny golden cup, skewered by the handle on the swords blade was 
flung into the air. The goblin astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although he 
could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it, even while countless Hufflepuff 
cups burst from his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up 
again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery 
gold and silver that bore him, Ron, Hermione into the outer chamber. 

 Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along 
the swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to 
retrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harrys shoulders the moment 
he could, he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the 
sword and crying, Thieves! Thieves! Help! Thieves! He vanished into the midst of the 
advancing crowd, all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without 
question. 

 Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way 
out was through. 

 Stupefy! he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in: Jets of red light flew 
into the crowd of goblins, and some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry saw 
several wizard guards running around the corner. 

 The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over the goblins; The 
wizards fled, doubled-up, back the way they had come, and inspiration, or madness, came 
to Harry. Pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled, 
Relashio! 

 The cuffs broken open with loud bangs. 

 This way! Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advancing 
goblins, he sprinted toward the blind dragon. 

 Harry C Harry C what are you doing? cried Hermione. 

 Get up, climb up, come on C 


 The dragon had not realized that it was free: Harrys foot found the crook of its 
hind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back. The scales were hard as steel; it did not 
even seem to feel him. He stretched out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron 
climbed on behind them, and a second later the dragon became aware that it was 
untethered. 

 With a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly as he could to 
the jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles, 
and it soared into the air. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against the 
ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening, while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers 
that glanced off its flanks. 

 Well never get out, its too big! Hermione screamed, but the dragon opened its 
mouth and belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and 
crumbled. By sheer force, the dragon clawed and fought its way through. Harrys eyes 
were shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the crash of rock and the dragons 
roars, he could only cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he 
heard Hermione yelling, Defodio! 

 She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as it 
struggled upward toward the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins: 
Harry and Ron copied her, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They 
passed the underground lake, and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed to sense 
freedom and space ahead of it, and behind them the passage was full of the dragons 
thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the 
clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while ahead, the dragons 
fire kept their progress clear C 

 And then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the dragons brute 
strength, they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway. Goblins 
and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and finally the dragon had room to stretch its 
wings: Turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the 
entrance, it took off, and with Harry, Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it 
forced its way through the metal doors, leaving them buckled and hanging from their 
hinges, as it staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky. 

 

 

 

Chapter Twenty-Seven 

The Final Hiding Place 

 

There was no means of steering; the dragon could not see where it was 
going, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they 
would find it impossible to cling onto its broad back. Nevertheless, as they 
climbed higher and higher, London unfurling below them like a gray-and-green 
map, Harry's overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that had 
seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast's neck, he clung tight to 


the metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and 
blistered skin, the dragon's wings beating the air like the sails of a 
windmill. Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell. Ron 
kept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing. 
After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that 
the dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but 
getting as far away from its underground prison as possible; but the 
question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening. 
He had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing, nor how this 
particular dragon, which could barely see, would locate a good place to put 
down. He glanced around constantly, imagining that he could feel his seat 
prickling. 
How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into the 
Lestranges' vault? How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix? 
How quickly would they realize what had been taken? And then, when they 
discovered that the golden cup was missing? Voldemort would know, at last, 
that they were hunting Horcruxes. 
The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air. It climbed steadily 
until they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud, and Harry could no 
longer make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out 
of the capital. On and on they flew, over countryside parceled out in 
patches of green and brown, over roads and rivers winding through the 
landscape like strips of matte and glossy ribbon. 
"What do you reckon it's looking for?" Ron yelled as they flew farther 
and farther north. 
"No idea," Harry bellow back. His hands were numb with cold but he did 
not date attempt to shift his grip. He had been wondering for some time what 
they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if the dragon headed 
for open seal he was cold and numb, not to mention desperately hungry and 
thirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? Surely it would 
need sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it realized it had 
three highly edible humans sitting on its back? 
The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still 
the dragon flew, cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them, its 
enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a giant dark cloud. Every part 
of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon's back. 
"Is it my imagination," shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of 
silence, "or are we losing height?" 
Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in the 
sunset. the landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted 
over the side of the dragon, and he wondered whether it had divined the 
presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight. 
Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, honing in, 
it seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes. 
"I say we jump when it gets low enough!" Harry called back to the 
others. "Straight into the water before it realizes we're here!" 


 They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could see the 
dragon's wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water. 
"NOW!" 
He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward 
the surface of the lake; the drop was greater than he had estimated and he 
hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a freezing, green, 
reed-filled world. He kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see 
enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione 
had fallen. The dragon did not seem to have noticed anything; it was already 
fifty feet away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred 
snout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths 
of the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last 
on a distant bank. 
Harry, Ron and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The lake did 
not seem to be deep. Soon it was more a question of fighting their way 
through reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden, 
panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass. 
Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have 
happily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, 
and started casting the usual protective spells around them. 
When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that 
he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red 
burns all over their faces and arms, and their clothing was singed away in 
places. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their many 
injuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of 
pumpkin juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for 
all of them. They changes and then gulped down the juice. 
"Well, on the upside," said Ron finally, who was sitting watching the 
skin on his hands regrow, "we got the Horcrux. On the downside-" 
"-- no sword," said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany 
through the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath. 
"No sword," repeated Ron. "That double-crossing little scab..." 
Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just 
taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them. Glinting in the 
sun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice. 
"At least we can't wear it this time, that'd look a bit weird hanging 
around our necks," said Ron, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. 
Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank where the dragon was 
still drinking. 
"What'll happen to it, do you think?" she asked, "Will it be alright?" 
"You sound like Hagrid," said Ron, "It's a dragon, Hermione, it can look 
after itself. It's us we need to worry about." 
"What do you mean?" 
"Well I don't know how to break this to you," said Ron, "but I think 
they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts." 
All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult 


to stop. Harry's ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay 
back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was 
raw. 
"What are we going to do, though?" said Hermione finally, hiccuping 
herself back to seriousness. "He'll know, won't he? You-Know-Who will know 
we know about his Horcruxes!" 
"Maybe they'll be too scared to tell him!" said Ron hopefully, "Maybe 
they'll cover up --" 
The sky, the smell of the lake water, the sound of Ron's voice were 
extinguished. Pain cleaved Harry's head like a sword stroke. He was standing 
in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on the floor 
at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure. 
"What did you say to me?" His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear 
burned inside him. The one thing that he had dreaded - but it could not be 
true, he could not see how... 
The goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his. 
"Say it again!" murmured Voldemort. "Say it again!" 
"M-my Lord," stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror, 
"m-my Lord... we t-tried to st-stop them... Im-impostors, my Lord... broke - 
broke into the - into the Lestranges' vault..." 
"Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing 
impostors? Who were they? 
"It was... it was... the P-Potter b-boy and the t-two accomplices..." 
"And they took?" he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping 
him, "Tell me! What did they take?" 
"A... a s-small golden c-cup m-my Lord..." 
The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger's. He 
was crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody had 
known. How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret? 
The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through 
the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over dead; the watching wizards 
scattered before him, terrified. Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others 
behind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, 
and those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, 
for hearing about the golden cup - 
Alone amongst the dead he stomped up and down, and they passed before him 
in vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality - the 
diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen. What if, what if, the boy knew 
about the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced more of 
them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had always 
suspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was 
his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the 
boy - 
But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord 
Voldemort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of 
them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore and of how 


many other worthless, nameless men. How could Lord Voldemort not have known, 
if he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated? 
True, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had 
thought that was because he had no body to fell, being less than ghost... 
No, surely, the rest were safe... The other Horcruxes must be intact... 
But he must know, he must be sure... He paced the room, kicking aside 
the goblin's corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his 
boiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts - 
A modicum of calm cooled his rage now. How could the boy know that he 
had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be 
related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection, the killings had never 
been traced to him. The ring, surely, was safe. 
And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate 
its protection? The idea of the locket being stolen was absurd... 
As for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the 
Horcrux, because he alone had plumed the deepest secrets of that place... 
And there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent to 
do his bidding, under his protection... 
But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding 
places, he must redouble protection around each of his Horcruxes... A job, 
like the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone... 
Which should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease 
flickered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle name... Dumbledore 
might have made the connection with the Gaunts... Their abandoned home was, 
perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that he would 
go first... 
The lake, surely impossible... though was there a slight possibility 
that Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds, through the 
orphanage. 
And Hogwarts... but he knew the his Horcrux there was safe; it would be 
impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the 
school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that 
the boy might try to reenter the castle. ... To tell Snape why the boy might 
return would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust 
Bellatrix and Malfoy. Didn't their stupidity and carelessness prove how 
unwise it was ever to trust? 
He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him. He 
would not be parted from the snake anymore ... and he strode from the room, 
through the hall, and out into the dark garden where the fountain played; he 
called the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a 
long shadow. ... 
Harry's eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present. He 
was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione 
were looking down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and by the 
continued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion into Voldemort's mind 
had not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that 


he was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass 
before him, and the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the falling sun. 
"He knows." His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort's high 
screams. "He knows and he's going to check where the others are, and the 
last one," he was already on his feet," is at Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew 
it." 
"What?" 
Ron was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried. 
"But what did you see? How do you know?" 
"I saw him find out about the cup, I - I was in his head, he's" - Harry 
remembered the killings - "he's seriously angry, and scared too, he can't 
understand how we knew, and now he's going to check the others are safe, the 
ring first. He things the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape's there, 
because it'll be so hard not to be seen getting in. I think he'll check that 
one last, but he could still be there within hours -" 
"Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?" asked Ron, now scrambling to his 
feet too. 
"No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn't think about 
exactly where it is -" 
"Wait, wait!" cried Hermione as Ron caught up to the Horcrux and Harry 
pulled out the Invisibility Cloak again. "We can't just go, we haven't got a 
plan, we need to -" 
"We need to get going," said Harry firmly. He had been hoping to sleep, 
looking forward to getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now, 
"Can you imagine what he's going to do once he realizes the ring and the 
locket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux, decides it isn't 
safe enough? 
"But how are we going to get in?" 
"We'll go to Hogsmeade," said Harry, "and try to work something out once 
we see what the protection around the school's like. Get under the Cloak, 
Hermione, I want to stick together this time." 
"But we don't really fit -" 
"It'll be dark, no one's going to notice our feet." 
The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water. The dragon 
had drunk its fill and risen into the air. They paused in their preparations 
to watch it climb higher and higher, now black against the rapidly darkening 
sky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain. Then Hermione walked forward 
and took her place between the other two, Harry pulled the Cloak down as far 
as it would go, and together they turned on the spot into the crushing 
darkness. 

Chapter Twenty-Eight 

The Missing Mirror 

 


 Harry's feet touched the road. He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: 
dark shop 

fronts, and the mist line of black mountains beyond the village and the curve in the road 
ahead that 

led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, 
and with a 

lurch of the hear, he remembered with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly 
a year before, 

supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore, all this in a second, upon landing -- and then, 
even as he 

relaxed his grip upon Ron's and Hermione's arms, it happened. 

 The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort's when he had realized 
the cup had 

been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry's body, and he knew that their appearance had 
caused it. 

Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks 
burst open 

and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the streets, their wands aloft. 

 Harry seized Ron's wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to 
run. Even 

attempting it would have give away their position. One of the Death Eaters raised his 
wand, and the 

scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains. 

 "Accio Cloak!" roared one of the Death Eaters 

 Harry seized his folds, but it made no attempt to escape. The Summoning Charm 
had not 

worked on it. 

 "Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?" yelled the Death Eater who had tried the 
charm and 

then to his fellows. "Spread now. He's here." 

 Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron and Hermione backed as 
quickly as 

possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They 
waited 

in the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying 
along the street 

from the Death Eaters' searching wands. 

 "Let's just leave!" Hermione whispered. "Disapparate now!" 

 "Great idea," said Ron, but before Harry could reply, a Death Eater shouted, 

 "We know you are here, Potter, and there's no getting away! We'll find you!" 

 "They were ready for us," whispered Harry. "They set up that spell to tell them 
we'd come. 

I reckon theyve done something to keep us here, trap us - " 

 "What about dementors?" called another Death Eater. "Let'em have free rein, 
they'd find him 

quick enough!" 


 "The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hands but his - " 

 " 'an dementors won't kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter's life, nor his soul. 
He'll be easier to 

kill if he's been Kissed first!" 

 There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors they 
would have to produce 

Patronuses which would give them away immediately. 

 "We're going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!" Hermione whispered. 

 Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold being spread over the street. Light 
was sucked from 

the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch blackness, he felt 
Hermione take hold 

of his arm and together, they turned on the spot. 

 The air through which they needed to move, seemed to have become solid: They 
could not 

Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and 
deeper 

into Harry's flesh. He, Ron and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their 
way along the wall 

trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, 
ten or more 

of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with 
their black cloaks 

and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure 
of it: They 

seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths he 
detested, tasting 

despair in the air, closing in - 

 He raised his wand: He could not, would not suffer the Dementor's Kiss, whatever 
happened afterward. 

It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered "Expecto Patronum!" 

 The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The Dementors scattered and 
there was a triumphant 

yell from somewhere out of sight 

 "It's him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag!" 

 The Dementors have retreated, the stars were popping out again and the footsteps 
of the Death Eaters 

were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a 
grinding of bolts 

nearby, a door opened on the left-side of the narrow street, and a rough voice said: 
"Potter, in here, quick!" 

 He obeyed without hesitation, the three of them hurried through the open doorway. 

 "Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!" muttered a tall figure, passing them on 
his way into the street 

and slammed the door behind him. 


 Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of 
a single candle, 

the grubby, sawdust bar of the Hog's Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through 
a second doorway, 

which led to a trickery wooden staircase, that they climbed as fast as they could. The 
stairs opened into 

a sitting room with a durable carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a single 
large oil painting of a blonde 

girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant sweetness. 

 Shouts reached from the streets below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak on, 
they hurried toward the 

grimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the Hog's 
Head's barman, was 

the only person not wearing a hood. 

 "So what?" he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. "So what? You send 
dementors down my street, 

I'll send a Patronus back at'em! I'm not having'em near me, I've told you that. I'm not 
having it!" 

 "That wasn't your Patronus," said a Death Eater. "That was a stag. It was 
Potter's!" 

 "Stag!" roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. "Stag! You idiot - Expecto 
Patronum!" 

 Something huge and horned erupted from the wand. Head down, it charged 
toward the High Street, and 

out of sight. 

 "That's not what I saw" said the Death Eater, though was less certainly 

 "Curfew's been broken, you heard the noise," one of his companions told the 
barman. "Someone was 

out on the streets against regulations - " 

 "If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!" 

 "You set off the Caterwauling Charm?" 

 "What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out 
my own front door? Do it, 

then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven't pressed your little Dark Marks, 
and summoned him. He's 

not going to like being called here, for me and my old cat, is he, now?" 

 "Don't worry about us." said one of the Death Eaters, "worry about yourself, 
breaking curfew!" 

 "And where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my pub's closed down? 
What will happen to your 

little sidelines then?" 

 "Are you threatening - ?" 

 "I keep my mouth shut, it's why you come here, isn't it?" 

 "I still say I saw a stag Patronus!" shouted the first Death Eater. 

 "Stag?" roared the barman. "It's a goat, idiot!" 


 "He's dead," said Harry, "Bellatrix Lestrange killed him." 

 The barman face was impassive. After a few moments he said, "I'm sorry to hear 
it, I liked that elf." 

 He turned away, lightning lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of 
them. 

 "You're Aberforth," said Harry to the man's back. 

 He neither confirmed or denied it, but bent to light the fire. 

 "How did you get this?" Harry asked, walking across to Sirius's mirror, the twin 
of the one he had broken 

nearly two years before. 

 "Bought it from Dung 'bout a year ago," said Aberforth. "Albus told me what it 
was. Been trying to keep 

an eye out for you." 

 Ron gasped. 

 "The silver doe," he said excitedly, "Was that you too?" 

 "What are you talking about?" asked Aberforth. 

 "Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!" 

 "Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven't I just prove my 
Patronus is a goat?" 

 "Oh," said Ron, "Yeah... well, I'm hungry!" he added defensively as his stomach 
gave an enormous 

rumble. 

 "I got food," said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments 
later with a large 

 "All right, we made a mistake," said the second Death Eater. "Break curfew again 
and we won't be so lenient!" 

 The Death Eaters strode back towards the High Street. Hermione moaned with 
relief, wove out from under the Cloak, 

and sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains then pulled the Cloak off 
himself and Ron. They could hear the 

barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs. 

 Harry's attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small, 
rectangular mirror, propped on top of it, 

right beneath the portrait of the girl. 

 The barman entered the room. 

 "You bloody fools," he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of them. "What 
were you thinking, coming here?" 

 "Thank you," said Harry. "You can't thank you enough. You saved our lives!" 

 The barman grunted. Harry approached him looking up into the face: trying to see 
past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair 

beard. He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue. 

 "It's your eye I've been seeing in the mirror." 

 There was a silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other. 

 "You sent Dobby." 

 The barman nodded and looked around for the elf. 

 "Thought he'd be with you. Where've you left him? 


loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in 
front of the fire. 

Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was sound of chewing. 

 "Right then," said Aberforth when the had eaten their fill and Harry and Ron sat 
slumped dozily in 

their chairs. "We need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can't be done by 
night, you heard what 

happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling Charm's set off, they'll 
be onto you like 

bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don't reckon I'll be able to pass of a stag as a goat a second 
time. Wait for daybreak 

when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out 
of Hogsmeade, up into 

the mountains, and you'll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He's been 
hiding in a cave up there with 

Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him." 

 "We're not leaving," said Harry. "We need to get into Hogwarts." 

 "Don't be stupid, boy," said Aberforth. 

 "We've got to," said Harry. 

 "What you've got to do," said Aberforth, leaning forward, "is to get as far from 
here as from here as you 

can." 

 "You don't understand. There isn't much time. We've got to get into the castle. 
Dumbledore - I mean, 

your brother - wanted us - " 

 The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth's glasses momentarily opaque, a 
bright flat white, and 

Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog. 

 "My brother Albus wanted a lot of things," said Aberforth, "and people had a 
habit of getting hurt while he 

was carrying out his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of the 
country if you can. Forget 

my brother and his clever schemes. He's gone where none of this can hurt him, and you 
don't owe him anything." 

 "You don't understand." said Harry again. 

 "Oh, don't I? said Aberforth quietly. "You don't think I understood my own 
brother? Think you know Albus 

better than I did?" 

 "I didn't mean that," said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and 
from the surfeit of food and wine. 

"It's... he left me a job." 

 "Did he now?" said Aberforth. "Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing 
you'd expect an unqualified 

wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?" 

 Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained. 

 "I-it's not easy, no," said Harry. "But I've got to - " 


 "Got to? Why got to? He's dead, isn't he?" said Aberforth roughly. "Let it go, boy, 
before you follow him! 

Save yourself!" 

 "I can't." 

 "Why not?" 

 "I - " Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the offensive 
instead. "But you're fighting too, 

you're in the Order of the Phoenix - " 

 "I was," said Aberforth. "The Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-Know-Who's 
won, it's over, and anyone 

who's pretending different's kidding themselves. It'll never be safe for you here, Potter, he 
wants you too badly. 

So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you." He jerked a 
thumb at Ron and Hermione. 

"They'll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows they've been working with 
you." 

 "I can't leave," said Harry. "I've got a job - " 

 "Give it to someone else!" 

 "I can't. It's got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all - " 

 "Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?" 

 Harry wanted him with all his heart to say "Yes," but somehow the simple word 
would not rise to his lips, 

Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking. 

 "I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and 
lies, that's how we grew 

up, and Albus... he was a natural." 

 The old man's eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece. It was, 
now Harry looked around 

properly, the only picture in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, 
nor of anyone else. 

 "Mr. Dumbledore" said Hermione rather timidly. "Is that your sister? Ariana? 

 "Yes." said Aberforth tersely. "Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy?" 

 Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red. 

 "Elphias Doge mentioned her to us," said Harry, trying to spare Hermione. 

 "That old berk," muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of mead. "Thought the 
sun shone out of my 

brother's every office, he did. Well, so did plenty of people, you three included, by the 
looks of it." 

 Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about 
Dumbledore that had 

riddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby's grave, he had 
decided to continue 

along the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that 
he had not been told 

everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no desire to doubt again; 
he did not want o hear 


anything that would deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth's gaze, which was so 
strikingly like his 

brothers': The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the 
object of their scrutiny, 

and Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it. 

 "Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much," said Hermione in a low 
voice. 

 "Did he now?" said Aberforth. "Funny thing how many of the people my brother 
cared about very much 

ended up in a worse state than if he'd left 'em well alone." 

 "What do you mean?" asked Hermione breathlessly. 

 "Never you mind," said Aberforth. 

 "But that's a really serious thing to say!" said Hermione. "Are you - are you 
talking about your sister?" 

 Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was 
holding back. Then he burst 

into speech. 

 "When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, by three Muggle boys. 
They'd seen her doing magic, 

spying through the back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn't control it, no witch or 
wizard can at that age. 

What they saw, scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and 
when she couldn't show them 

the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it." 

 Hermione's eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick. Aberforth 
stood up, tall as Albus, and 

suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain. 

 "It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn't use 
magic, but she couldn't get rid 

of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn't control 
it, and at times she was 

strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless. 

 "And my father went after the bastards that did it," said Aberforth, "and attacked 
them. And they locked him 

up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because the Ministry had known 
what Ariana had become, 

she'd have been locked up in St. Mungo's for good. They'd have seen her as a serious 
threat to the International 

Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments 
when she couldn't keep it 

in any longer. 

 "We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and 
my mother looked after 

her, and tried to keep her calm and happy. 

 "I was her favourite," he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to 
look out through Aberforth's 


wrinkles and wrangled beard. "Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was 
home, reading his books 

and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with "the most notable 
magical names of the day," 

Aberforth succored. "He didn't want to be bothered with her. She liked me best. I could 
get her to eat when she wouldn't 

do it for my mother, I could calm her down, when she was in one of her rages, and when 
she was quiet, she used to 

help me feed the goats. 

 "Then, when she was fourteen... See, I wasn't there." said Aberforth. "If I'd been 
there, I could have calmed 

her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn't as young as she was, and . . . it 
was an accident. Ariana 

couldn't control it. But my mother was killed." 

 Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any 
more, but Aberforth kept talking, 

and Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in 
fact, he had ever spoken about it. 

 "So that put paid to Albus's trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of 'em 
came home for my mother's 

funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. 
Ha!" 

 Aberforth spat into the fire. 

 "I'd have looked after her, I told him so, I didn't care about school, I'd have stayed 
home and done it. 

He told me I had to finish my education and he'd take over from my mother. Bit of a 
comedown for Mr. Brilliant, 

there's no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house 
every other day. But he 

did all right for a few weeks . . . till he came." 

 And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforths face. 

 "Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to someone just as 
bright and talented he was. And 

looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a 
new Wizarding order and looking 

for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the 
benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one 

young girl neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater 
good? 

 "But after a few weeks of it, I'd had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go 
hack to Hogwarts, so I told 'em, 

both of 'em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now," and Aberforth looked downward Harry, 
and it took a little imagination to 

see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. "I told him, you'd 
better give it up now. You can't move her, 


she's in no fit state, you can't take her with you, wherever it is you're planning to go, 
when you're making your clever speeches, 

trying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn't like that." said Aberforth, and his 
eyes were briefly occluded by the fireflight on 

the lenses of his glasses: They turned white and blind again. "Grindelwald didn't like that 
at all. He got angry. He told me what a 

stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother . . . 
Didn't I understand, my poor sister wouldn't 

have to be hidden once they'd changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and 
taught the Muggles their place? 

 "And there was an argument . . . and I pulled my wand, and he pulled out his, and 
I had the Cruciatus Curse used on 

me by my brother's best friend - and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us 
were dueling, and the flashing lights 

and the bangs set her off, she couldn't stand it - " 

 The color was draining from Aberforth's face as though he had suffered a mortal 
wound. 

 " - and I think she wanted to help, but she didn't really know what she was doing, 
and I don't know which of us did it, 

it could have been any of us - and she was dead." 

 His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. 
Hermione's face was wet with tears, and Ron 

was almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not 
heard it, wished he could wash is mind clean of it. 

 "I'm so . . . I'm so sorry," Hermione whispered. 

 "Gone," croaked Aberforth. "Gone forever." 

 He wiped his nose on hiss cuff and cleared his throat. 

 " 'Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in 
his own country, and he didn't want Ariana 

set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn't he? Free of the burden of his sister, 
free to become the greatest wizard of the - " 

 "He was never free," said Harry. 

 "I beg your pardon?" said Aberforth. 

 "Never," said Harry. "The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that 
drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, 

pleading with someone who wasn't there. 'Don't hurt them, please . . . hurt me instead.' " 

 Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about 
what had happened on the island on the lake: 

The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had 
eclipsed it so thoroughly. 

 "He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did," said 
Harry, remembering Dumbledore whispering, pleading. 

"He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana . . . It was torture to 
him, if you'd seen him then, you wouldn't say he was free." 

 Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. 
After a long pause he said. "How can you be sure, Potter, 


that my brother wasn't more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be 
sure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?" 

 A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart. 

 "I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry," said Hermione. 

 "Why didn't he tell him to hide, then? shot back Aberforth. "Why didn't he say to 
him, 'Take care of yourself, here's how to survive' ?" 

 "Because," said Harry before Hermione could answer, "sometimes you've got to 
think about more than your own safety! Sometimes 

you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!" 

 "You're seventeen, boy!" 

 "I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!" 

 "Who says I've given up?" 

 "The Order of the Phoenix is finished," Harry repeated, "You-Know-Who's won, 
it's over, and anyone who's pretending different's kidding 

themselves." 

 "I don't say I like it, but it's the truth!" 

 "No, it isn't." said Harry. "Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and 
he passed the knowledge on to me. I'm going to keep going 

until I succeed - or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for 
years." 

 He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely moved. 

 "We need to get into Hogwarts," said Harry again. "If you can't help us, we'll wait 
till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way 

in ourselves. If you can help us - well, now would be a great time to mention it." 

 Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eye, that were so 
extraordinarily like his brother's. At last he cleared his 

throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of Ariana. 

 "You know what to do," he said. 

 She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, one of 
the sides of their frames, but along what seemed to 

be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight figure retreating until finally 
she was swallowed by the darkness. 

 "Er - what - ?" began Ron. 

 "There's only one way in now," said Aberforth. "You must know they've got all 
the old secret passageways covered at both ends, dementors 

all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell 
me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. 

How you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the 
Carrows as his deputies. . . well, that's your lookout, isn't it? 

You say you're prepared to die." 

 "But what . . . ?" said Hermione, frowning at Ariana's picture. 

 A tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was 
walking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger 

as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, 
who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was 


longer than Harry had ever seen. He appeared and torn. Larger and larger the two figures 
grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. 

Then the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a 
real tunnel was revealed. And our of it, his hair overgrown, 

his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of 
delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled. 

"I knew you'd come! I knew it, Harry!" 

 

Chapter Twenty-Nine 

The Lost Diadem 

Neville -- what the -- how -- ? 

 But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with yells of delight was hugging 
them too. The longer Harry looked at Neville, the worse he appeared: One of his eyes 
was swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks on his face, and his general air of 
unkemptness suggested that he had been living enough. Nevertheless, his battered visage 
shone with happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, I knew youd come! Kept 
telling Seamus it was a matter of time! 

 Neville, whats happened to you? 

 What? This? Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. This is 
nothing, Seamus is worse. Youll see. Shall we get going then? Oh, he turned to 
Aberforth, Ab, there might be a couple more people no the way. 

 Couple more? repeated Aberforth ominously. What dyou mean, a couple 
more, Longbottom? Theres a curfew and a Camwaulding Charm on the whole village! 

 I know, thats why theyll be Apparating directly into the bar, said Neville. 
Just send them down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot. 

 Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto the 
mantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville. Harry addressed Aberforth. 

 I dont know how to thank you. Youve saved our lives twice. 

 Look after em, then, said Aberforth gruffly. I might not be able to save em a 
third time. 

 Harry chambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind Arianas 
portrait. There were smooth stone steps on the other side: It looked as though the 
passageway had been there for years. Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy 
floor was worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows rippled, fanlike, across the 
wall. 

 How longs this been here? Ron asked as they set off. It isnt on the 
Marauders Map, is it Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of 
school? 

 They sealed off all of those before the start of the year, said Neville. Theres 
no chance of getting through any of them now, not with the curses over the entrances and 
Death Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits. He started walking backward, beaming, 
drinking them in. Never mind that stuff  Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did 
you escape on a dragon? Its everywhere, everyones talking about it, Terry Boot got 
beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner! 


 Yeah, its true, said Harry. 

 Neville laughed gleefully. 

 What did you do with the dragon? 

 Released it into the wild, said Ron. Hermione was all for keeping it as a pet 

 Dont exaggerate, Ron C 

 But what have you been doing? People have been saying youve just been on the 
run, Harry, but I dont think so. I think youve been up to something. 

 Youre right, said Harry, but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we havent heard 
anything. 

 Its been . Well, its not really like Hogwarts anymore, said Neville, the smile 
fading from his face as he spoke. Do you know about the Carrows? 

 Those two Death Eaters who teach here? 

 They do more than teach, said Neville. Theyre in charge of all discipline. 
They like punishment, the Carrows. 

 Like Umbridge? 

 Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to 
the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They dont, though, if they can avoid it. You can 
tell they all hate them as much as we do. 

 Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, 
except now its just the Dark Arts. Were supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on 
people whove earned detentions C  

 What? 

 Harry, Ron, and Hermiones united voices echoed up and down the passage. 

 Yeah, said Neville. Thats how I got this one, he pointed at a particularly 
deep gash in his cheek, I refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and 
Goyle love it. First time theyve ever been top in anything, I expect. 

 Alecto, Amycuss sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for 
everyone. Weve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and 
dirty, and how they drive wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the 
natural order is being reestablished. I got this one, he indicated another slash to his face, 
for asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got. 

 Blimey, Neville, said Ron, theres a time and a place for getting a smart 
mouth. 

 You didnt see her, said Neville. You wouldnt have stood it either. The thing 
is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that 
when you did it, Harry. 

 But theyve used you as a knife sharpener, said Ron, winding slightly as they 
passed a lamp and Nevilles injuries were thrown into even greater relief. 

 Neville shrugged. 

 Doesnt matter. They dont want to spill too much pure blood, so theyll torture 
us a bit if were mouthy but they wont actually kill us. 

 Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying or the 
matter-of-fact tone in which he said them. 

 The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the 
outside are giving trouble. They get taken hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit 


too outspoken in The Quibbler, so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for 
Christmas. 

 Neville, shes all right, weve seen her C 

 Yeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me. 

 From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized it as one of the 
fake Galleons that Dumbledores Army had used to send one another messages. 

 These have been great, said Neville, beaming at Hermione. The Carrows never 
rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak out at night 
and put graffiti on the walls: Dumbledores Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. Snape 
hated it. 

 You used to? said Harry, who had noticed the past tense. 

 Well, it got more difficult as time went one, said Neville. We lost Luna at 
Christmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of the 
leaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming 
down on me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year 
theyd chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off. 

 No kidding, muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upward. 

 Yeah, well, I couldnt ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped 
those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a 
couple of weeks ago. Thats when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I 
suppose, and they went for Gran. 

 They what? said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together. 

 Yeah, said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so 
steeply, well, you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to 
force their relatives to behave. I spose it was only a matter of time before they did it the 
other way around. Thing was, he faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he 
was grinning, they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch 
living alone, they probably thought hey didnt need to send anyone particularly powerful. 
Anyway, Neville laughed, Dawlish is still in St. Mungos and Grans on the run. She 
sent me a letter, he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, telling me she was 
proud of me, that Im my parents son, and to keep it up. 

 Cool, said Ron. 

 Yea, said Neville happily. Only thing was, once they realized they had no hold 
over me, they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I dont know whether they 
were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban, either way, I knew it was time to 
disappear. 

 But, said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, arent C arent we heading 
straight back for Hogwarts? 

 Course, said Neville. Youll see. Were here. 

 They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. Another 
short flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind Arianas portrait. Neville 
pushed it open and climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out for 
unseen people: 

 Look who it is! Didnt I tell you? 

 As Harry emerged into the room behind the passage, there were several screams 
and yells: HARRY! Its Potter, its POTTER! Ron! Hermione! 


 He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many faces. The 
next moment, he, Ron, and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their 
hair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people. They 
might have just won a Quidditch final. 

 Okay, okay, calm down! Neville called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry 
was able to take in their surroundings. 

 He did not recognize the dorm at all. It was enormous, and looked rather like the 
interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ships cabin. 
Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from the balcony that ran 
around the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were covered in bright 
tapestry hangings. Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black 
badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. 
The silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few 
broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wood-cased wireless. 

 Where are we? 

 Room of Requirement, of course! said Neville. Surpassed itself, hasnt it? The 
Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout: I managed to 
get through the door and this is what I found! Well, it wasnt exactly like this when I 
arrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. 
But its expanded as more and more of the D.A. have arrived. 

 And the Carrows cant get in? asked Harry, looking around for the door. 

 No, said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he spoke: 
Seamuss face was bruised and puffy. Its a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in 
here, they cant get at us, the door wont open. Its all down to Neville. He really gets this 
room. Youve got to ask for exactly what you need C like, I dont want any Carrow 
supporters to be able to get in C and itll do it for you! Youve just got to make sure you 
close the loopholes. Nevilles the man! 

 Its quite straightforward, really, said Neville modestly. Id been in here about 
a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and 
thats when the passage to Hogs Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. 
Hes been providing us with food, because for some reason, thats the one thing the room 
doesnt really do. 

 Yeah, well, foods one of the five exceptions to Gamps Law of Elemental 
Transfiguration, said Ron to general astonishment. 

 So weve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks, said Seamus, and it just 
makes more hammocks every time we need room, and it even sprouted a pretty good 
bathroom once girls started turning up C  

 and thought theyd quite like to wash, yes, supplied Lavender Brown, whom 
Harry had not noticed until that point. Now that he looked around properly, he recognized 
many familiar faces. Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, 
Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner. 

 Tell us what youve been up to, though, said Ernie. Thereve been so many 
rumors, weve been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch. He pointed at the 
wireless. You didnt break into Gringotts? 

 They did! said Neville. And the dragons true too! 

 There was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow. 


 What were you after? asked Seamus eagerly. 

 Before any of them could parry the question with one of their own, Harry felt a 
terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As he turned his back hastily on the curious 
and delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a 
ruined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred 
golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemorts scream of fury vibrated 
inside his head. 

 With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemorts mind again, back to where 
he stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and Ron 
holding him up. 

 Are you all right, Harry? Neville was saying. What to sit down? I expect 
youre tired, arent -- ? 

 No, said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them without 
words that Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes. Time 
was running out fast: If Voldemort chose to visit Hogwarts next, they would miss their 
chance. 

 We need to get going, he said, and their expressions told him that they 
understood. 

 What are we going to do, then, Harry? asked Seamus. Whats the plan? 

 Plan? repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower to prevent himself 
succumbing again to Voldemorts rage: His scar was still burning. Well, theres 
something we C Ron, Hermione, and I C need to do, and then well get out of here. 

 Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked confused. 

 What dyou mean, get out of here? 

 We havent come back to stay, said Harry, rubbing his scar, trying to soothe the 
pain. Theres something important we need to do C  

 What is it? 

 I C I cant tell you. 

 There was a ripple of muttering at this: Nevilles brows contracted. 

 Why cant you tell us? Its something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, 
right? 

 Well, yeah C  

 Then well help you. 

 The other members of Dumbledores Army were nodding, some enthusiastically, 
others solemnly. A couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness 
for immediate action. 

 You dont understand, Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. 
We C we cant tell you. Weve got to do it C alone. 

 Why? asked Neville. 

 Because   In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at 
least have a private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they might 
commence their search. Harry found it difficult to gather his thoughts. His scar was still 
searing. Dumbledore left the three of us a job, he said carefully, and we werent 
supposed to tell C I mean, he wanted us to do it, just the three of us. 

 Were his army, said Neville. Dumbledores Army. We were all in it together, 
weve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own C 


 It hasnt exactly been a picnic, mate, said Ron. 

 I never said it had, but I dont see why you cant trust us. Everyone in this 
rooms been fighting and theyve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting 
them down. Everyone in heres proven theyre loyal to Dumbledore C loyal to you. 

 Look, Harry began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it did not 
matter. The tunnel door had just opened behind him. 

 We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you must be here! 

 It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best 
friend. 

 Hi, everyone! said Luna happily. Oh, its great to be back! 

 Luna, said Harry distractedly, what are you doing here? How did you -- ? 

 I sent for her, said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. I promised her and 
Ginny that if you turned up Id let them know. We all thought that if you came back, it 
would mean revolution. That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows. 

 Of course thats what it means, said Luna brightly. Isnt it, Harry? Were 
going to fight them out of Hogwarts? 

 Listen, said Harry with a rising sense of panic, Im sorry, but thats not what 
we came back for. Theres something weve got to do, and then C 

 Youre going to leave us in this mess? demanded Michael Cornet. 

 No! said Ron. What were doing will benefit everyone in the end, its all about 
trying to get rid of You-Know-Who C  

 Then let us help! said Neville angrily. We want to be a part of it! 

 There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His heart seemed to fall: 
Ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, 
and Lee Jordan. Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile: He had forgotten, he had never fully 
appreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less pleased to see her. 

 Aberforths getting a bit annoyed, said Fred, raising his hand in answer to 
several cries of greeting. He wants a kip, and his bars turned into a railway station. 

 Harrys mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harrys old girlfriend, 
Cho Chang. She smiled at him. 

 I got the message, she said, holding up her own fake Galleon and she walked 
over to sit beside Michael Corner. 

 So whats the plan, Harry? said George. 

 There isnt one, said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all 
these people, unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely. 

 Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite kind, said Fred. 

 Youve got to stop this! Harry told Neville. What did you call them all back 
for? This is insane C  

 Were fighting, arent we? said Dean, taking out his fake Galleon. The 
message said Harry was back, and we were going to fight! Ill have to get a wand, though 
C 

 You havent got a wand--? began Seamus. 

 Ron turned suddenly to Harry. 

 Why cant they help? 

 What? 


 They can help. He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them could hear 
but Hermione, who stood between them, We dont know where it is. Weve got to find it 
fast. We dont have to tell them its a Horcrux. 

 Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, I think Rons right. We 
dont even know what were looking for, we need them. And when Harry looked 
unconvinced, You dont have to do everything alone, Harry. 

 Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split again. 
Dumbledore had warned him against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione about the 
Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, thats how we grew up, and Albus  he was a natural  
Was he turning into Dumbledore, keeping his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? 
But Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had that led? To murder at the top of the 
highest tower  

 All right, he said quietly to the other two. Okay, he called to the room at large, 
and all noise ceased: Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of 
those nearest, fell silent, and all of the looked alert, excited. 

 Theres something we need to find, Harry said. Something C something thatll 
help us overthrow You-Know-Who. Its here at Hogwarts, but we dont know where. It 
might have belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone 
come across something with her eagle on it, for instance? 

 He looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to Padma, Michael, 
Terry, and Cho, but it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of Ginnys chair. 

 Well, theres her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember, Harry? The lost 
diadem of Ravenclaw? Daddys trying to duplicate it. 

 Yeah, but the lost diadem, said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes, is lost, Luna. 
Thats sort of the point. 

 When was it lost? asked Harry. 

 Centuries ago, they say, said Cho, and Harrys heart sank. Professor Flitwick 
says the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself. People have looked, but, she 
appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws. Nobodys ever found a trace of it, have them? 

 They all shook their heads. 

 Sorry, but what is a diadem? asked Ron. 

 Its a kind of crown, said Terry Boot. Ravenclaws was supposed to have 
magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer. 

 Yes, Daddys Wrackspurt siphons C  

 But Harry cut across Luna. 

 And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it? 

 They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own 
disappointment was mirrored back at him. An object that had been lost this long, and 
apparently without trace, did not seem like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in 
the castle  Before he could formulate a new question, however, Cho spoke again. 

 If youd like to see what the diadems supposed to look like, I could take you up 
to our common room and show you, Harry. Ravenclaws wearing it in her statue. 

 Harrys scar scorched again: For a moment the Room of Requirement swam 
before him, and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great 
snake wrapped around his shoulders. Voldemort was flying again, whether to the 


underground lake or here, to the castle, he did not know: Either way, there was hardly 
any time left. 

 Hes on the move, he said quietly to Ron and Hermione. He glanced at Cho and 
then back at them. Listen, I know its not much of a lead, but Im going to go look at 
this statue, at least find out what the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you 
know C the other one C safe. 

 Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, No, Luna will take Harry, 
wont you, Luna? 

 Oooh, yes, Id like to, said Luna happily, as Cho sat down again, looking 
disappointed. 

 How do we get out? Harry asked Neville. 

 Over here. 

 He led Harry and Luna to a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto a steep 
staircase. It comes out somewhere different every day, so theyve never been able to 
find it, he said. Only trouble is, we never know exactly where were going to end up 
when we go out. Be careful, Harry, theyre always patrolling the corridors at night. 

 No problem, said Harry. See you in a bit. 

 He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and turned 
corners in unexpected places. At last they reached what appeared to be solid wall. 

 Get under here, Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and throwing 
it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push. 

 It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside. Harry glanced back and saw 
that it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark corridor. Harry pulled 
Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the 
Marauders Map. Holding it close to his nose he searched, and located his and Lunas 
dots at last. 

 Were up on the fifth floor, he whispered, watching filch moving away from 
them, a corridor ahead. Come on, this way. 

 They crept off. 

 Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had his heart 
hammered that fast, never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place. 
Through squares of moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets creaked 
at the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked. 
Harry and Luna walked, checking the Marauders Map whenever light permitted, twice 
pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to 
encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears 
with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the poltergeists approach. 

 The way, Harry, breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a 
spiral staircase. 

 They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here before. At 
last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole: nothing but a plain 
expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape an eagle. 

 Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair, unconnected 
to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon 
blast. At once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a birds called, a soft, musical 
voice said, Which came first, the phoenix or the flame? 


 Hmm  What do you think, Harry? said Luna, looking thoughtful. 

 What? Isnt there a password? 

 Oh no, youve got to answer a question, said Luna. 

 What if you get it wrong? 

 Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right, said Luna. That way 
you learn, you see? 

 Yeah  Trouble is, we cant really afford to wait for anyone else, Luna. 

 No, I see what you mean, said Luna seriously. Well then, I think the answer is 
that a circle has no beginning. 

 Well reasoned, said the voice, and the door swung open. 

 The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any 
Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful arched windows punctuated the walls, which 
were hung with blue-and-bronze silks. By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular 
view of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which 
were echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in 
a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble. 

 Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Lunas house. 
The statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. He strode right 
up to the marble woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile 
on her face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. A delicate-looking circlet had been 
reproduced in marble on top of her head. It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her 
wedding. There were tiny words etched into it. Harry stepped out from under the Cloak 
and climbed up onto Ravenclaws plinth to read them. 

 Wit beyond measure is mans greatest treasure. 

 Which makes you pretty skint, witless, said a cackling voice. 

 Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor. The sloping-
shouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and even as Harry raised 
his wand, she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm. 

Chapter Thirty 

The Sacking of Severus Snape 

 The moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry's scar burned savagely, the starry 
room vanished from sight, and he was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff, 
and the sea was washing around him and there was a triumph in his heart C They have the 
boy. 

 A loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood. Disoriented, he raised his 
wand, but the witch before him was already falling forward; she hit the ground so hard 
that the glass in the bookcases tinkled. 

 I've never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons, said Luna, sounding 
mildly interested. That was noisier than I though it would be. 

 And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble Scurrying, echoing footsteps 
were growing louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories. Luna's spell had 
woken Ravenclaws sleeping above. 

 Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak! 


 Luna's feet appeared out of nowhere,; he hurried to her side and she let the Cloak 
fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in their 
nightclothes, flooded into the common room. there were gasps and cries of surprise as 
they saw Alecto lying there unconscious. Slowly they shuffled in around her, a savage 
beast that might wake at any moment and attack them. Then one brave little first-year 
darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe. 

 I think she might be dead! he shouted with delight. 

 Oh look, whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto. 
They're pleased! 

 Yeah... great...  

 Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into 
Voldemort's mind.... He was moving along the tunnel into the first cave.... He had 
chosen to make sure of the locker before coming...but that would not take him long.... 

 There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze. From the 
other side, Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker: 
Where do Vanished objects go? 

 I dunno, do I? Shut it! snarled an uncouth voice that Harry knew was that of 
the Carrow brother , Amycus, Alecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have you got him? 
Open the door! 

 The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified. Then without 
warning, there came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was firing a gun into the 
door. 

 ALECTO! If he comes, and we haven't got Potter --d'you want to go the same 
way as the Malfoys? ANSWER ME! Amycus bellowed, shaking the door for all he 
was worth, but still it did not open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of 
the most frightened began scampering back up the stair case to their beds. Then, just as 
Harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus 
before the Death Eater could do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out 
beyond the door. 

 May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow? 

 Tryingto get-- through this damned-- door! shouted Amycus. Go and get 
Flitwick! Get him to open it, now! 

 But isn't your sister in there asked Professor McGonagall. Didn't Professor 
Flitwick let her in earlier this evening, at your urgent request? Perhaps she could open 
the door for you? Then you needn't wake up half the castle. 

 She ain't answering, you old besom! You open it! Garn! Do it, now! 

 Certainly, if you wish it, said Professor McGonagall, with awful coldness, 
There was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again. 

 Where do Vanished objects go? 

 Into non being, which is to say, everything, replied Professor McGonagall. 

 Nicely phrased, replied the eagle door knocker, and the door swung open. 

 The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as Amycus 
burst over the threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, 
doughy face and tiny eyes, which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. 
He let out a yell of fury and fear. 


 What've they done, the little whelps? he screamed. I'll Cruciate the lot of 'em 
till they tell me who did it---and what's the Dark Lord going to say? he shrieked, 
standing over his sister and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist, We haven't 
got him, and they've gone and killed her! 

 She's only Stunned, said Professor McGonagall impatiently, who had stooped 
down to examine Alecto. She'll be perfectly all right. 

 No she bludgering well won't! bellowed Amycus. Not after the Dark Lord 
gets hold of her! She's gone and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we've 
got Potter! 

 'Got Potter'? said Professor McGonagall sharply, What do you mean, 'got 
Potter'? 

 He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send for him 
if we caught him! 

 Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower! Potter belongs in 
my House! 

 Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice 
and affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him. 

 We was told he might come in here! said Carrow. I dunno why, do I? 

 Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room. Twice they 
passed right over the place where Harry and Luna stood. 

 We can push it off on the kids, said Amycus, his pig like face suddenly crafty. 
Yeah, that's what we'll do. We'll say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, them kids up 
there -- he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories --  and we'll say they 
forced her to pres her Mark, and that's why he got a false alarm.... He can punish them. 
Couple of kids more or less, what's the difference? 

 Only the difference between truth and lied, courage and cowardice, said 
Professor McGonagall, who had turned pale, a difference, in short, which you and your 
sister seem unable to appreciate. But let me make one thing very clear. You are not 
going to pass off y9our many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit 
it. 

 Excuse me? 

 Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor McGonagall, 
his face within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he 
were something disgusting she had found stuck to the lavatory seat. 

 It's not a case of what you'll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time's over. It's 
us what's in charge here now, and you'll back me up or you'll pay the price. 

 And he spat in her face. 

 Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, You shouldn't 
have done that. 

 As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, Crucio! 

 The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a 
drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of 
glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. 

I see what Bellatrix meant, said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, you 
need to really mean it. 


 Potter! whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. Potter--- you're 
here! What---? How---? She struggled to pull herself together. Potter, that was 
foolish! 

 He spat at you, said Harry. 

 Potter, I --- that was very --- gallant of you --- but don't you realize --? 

 Yeah, I do, Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him. Professor 
McGonagall, Voldemort's on the way. 

 Oh, are we allowed to say the name now? asked Luna with an air of interest, 
pulling off the Invisibility Cloak. The appearance of a second outlaw seemed to 
overwhelm Professor McGonagall, who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair, 
clutching at the neck of her old tartan dressing gown. 

 I don't think it makes any difference what we call him, Harry told Luna. He 
already knows where I am. 

 In a distant part of Harry's brain, that part connected to the angry, burning scar, he 
could see Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat.... He had 
nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood.... 

 You must flee, whispered Professor McGonagall, Now Potter, as quickly as 
you can! 

 I can't, said Harry, There's something I need to do. Professor, so you know 
where the diadem of Ravenclaw is? 

 The d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not --- hasn't it been lost for 
centuries? She sat up a little straighter Potter, it was madness, utter madness, for you 
to enter this castle--- 

 I had to, said Harry. Professor, there's something hidden here that I'm 
supposed to find, and it could be the diadem--- if I could just speak to Professor Flitwick-
-- 

 There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass. Amycus was coming round. 
Before Harry or Luna could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, pointed her wand 
at the groggy Death Eater, and said, Imperio. 

 Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then shuffled 
obediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with his own. Then he lay 
down on the floor beside Alecto. Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a 
length of shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked around the Carrows, 
binding them tightly together. 

 Potter, said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him again with superb 
indifference to the Carrows' predicament. if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named does indeed 
know that you are here--- 

 As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry, setting 
his scar on fire, and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned 
clear, and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surface---. 

 Potter, are you all right. said a voice, and Harry came back. He was clutching 
Luna's shoulder to steady himself. 

 Time's running out, Voldemort's getting nearer, Professor, I'm acting on 
Dumbledore's orders, I must find what he wanted me to find! But we've got to get the 
students out while I'm searching the castle--- It's me Voldemort wants, but he won't care 


about killing a few more or less, not now--- not now he knows I'm attacking Horcruxes, 
Harry finished the sentence in his head. 

 You're acting on Dumbledore's orders? she repeated with a look of dawning 
wonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest height. 

 We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named while you 
search for this --- this object. 

 Is that possible? 

 I think so, said Professor McGonagall dryly, we teachers are rather good at 
magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our 
best efforts into it. Of course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape--- 

 Let me --- 

 ---and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the 
gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as 
possible. With the Floo Network under observation, and Apparition impossible within 
the grounds--- 

 There's a way, said Harry quickly, and he explained about the passageway 
leading into the Hog's Head. 

 Potter, we're talking about hundreds of students--- 

 I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on 
the school boundaries they won't be interested in anyone who's Disapparating out of 
Hog's Head. 

 There's something in that, she agreed. She pointed her wand at the Carrows, 
and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself around them, and hoisted them 
into the air, where they dangled beneath the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea 
creatures. Come. We must alert the other Heads of House. You'd better put that Cloak 
back on. 

 She marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her wand. From the tip 
burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes. the Patronuses ran 
sleekly ahead, filling the spiral staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, 
Harry, and Luna hurried back down. 

 Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them. Professor 
McGonagall's tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and Harry and Luna jogged 
behind her under the Cloak. 

 They had descended two more floors when another set of quiet joined theirs. 
Harry, whose scar was still prickling, heard them first. He felt in the pouch around his 
neck for the Marauder's Map, but before he could take it our, McGonagall too seemed to 
become aware of their company. She halted, raised her wand ready to duel, and said, 
Who's there? 

 It is I, said a low voice. 

 From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape. 

 Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him. He had forgotten the details of 
Snape's appearance in the magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his greasy black hair 
hung in curtains around his thin face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was 
not wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in his usual black cloak, and he too was 
holding his wand ready for a fight. 

 Where are the Carrows? he asked quietly. 


 Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus, said Professor McGonagall. 

 Snape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGonagall into the air 
around her, as if he knew that Harry was there. Harry held his wand up too, ready to 
attack. 

 I was under the impression, said Snape, That Alecto had apprehended an 
intruder. 

 Really? said Professor McGonagall. And what gave you that impression? 

 Snape mad a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark Mark was 
branded into his skin. 

 Oh, but naturally, said Professor McGonagall. You Death Eaters have your 
own private means of communication, I forgot. 

 Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still probing the air all 
about her, and he was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what he 
was doing. 

 I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors Minerva. 

 You have some objection? 

 I wonder what could have brought you out of our bed at this late hour? 

 I thought I heard a disturbance, said Professor McGonagall. 

 Really? But all seems calm. 

 Snape looked into her eyes. 

 Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have. I must insist--- 

 Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed. Her wand 
slashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, 
unconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was 
thrown off balance. =She brandished her wand at a touch on the wall and it flew out of 
its bracket. Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the 
descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a 
lasso at Snape--- 

 Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to 
smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing 
daggers. Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with 
echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another, into its breast--- 

 Minerva! said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna 
from flying spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor 
toward them in their nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at 
the rear. 

 No! squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. You'll do no more murder at 
Hogwarts! 

 Flitwick's spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had taken shelter. With 
a clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back 
toward his attackers. Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into 
the wall and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape was in full flight, 
McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering after him. He hurtled through a 
classroom door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, Coward! COWARD! 

 What's happened, what's happened? asked Luna. 


 Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the 
Invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors 
McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed window. 

 He jumped, said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the room. 

 You mean he's dead? Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick's and 
Sprout's yells of shock at his sudden appearance. 

 No, he's not dead, said McGonagall bitterly. Unlike Dumbledore, he was still 
carrying a wand... and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master. 

 With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, bat like shape flying 
through the darkness toward the perimeter wall. 

 There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puffing. Slughorn 
had just caught up. 

 Harry! he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath his emerald-green silk 
pajamas. My dear boy... what a surprise...Minerva, do please 
explain...Severus...what...? 

 Our headmaster is taking a short break, said Professor McGonagall, pointing at 
the Snape-shaped hole in the window. 

 Professor! Harry shouted his hand on his forehead, He could see the Inferi-
filled lake sliding beneath him, and he felt a ghostly green boat bump into the 
underground shore, and Voldemort lept from it with murder in his heart--- 

 Professor, we've got to barricade the school, he's coming now! 

 Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming, she told the other teachers. 
Sprout and Flitwick gasped. Slughorn let out a low groan. Potter has work to do in the 
castle on Dumbledore's orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are 
capable while Potter does what he needs to do. 

 You realize , of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-
Who indefinitely? squeaked Flitwick. 

 But we can hold him up. said Professor Sprout. 

 Thank you, Pomona, said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches 
there passed a look of grim understanding. I suggest we establish basic protection 
around the place, then gather our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be 
evacuated, though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight, I think they 
ought to be given the chance. 

 Agreed, said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the door. I shall meet 
you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House. 

 And as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering, Tentacula, Devil's 
Snare. And Snargaluff pods...yes, I'd like to see the Death Eaters fighting those. 

 I can act from here, said Flitwick, and although he could barely see out of it, he 
pointed his wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great 
complexity. Harry heard a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the 
power of the wind into the grounds. 

 Professor, Harry said, approaching the little Charms master. Professor, I'm 
sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of 
Ravenclaw is? 


 ---Protego Horribillis---the diadem of Ravenclaw? squeaked Flitwick. A little 
extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this 
situation! 

 I only meant --- do you know where it is? Have you ever seen it? 

 Seen it Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost, boy. 

 Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. What, then, was the 
Horcrux? 

 We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius! said 
Professor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her. 

 They had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into speech. 

 My word, he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache aquiver. What a 
to-do! I'm not at all sure whether this is wise, Minerva. He is bound to find a way in, 
you know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in the most grievous peril--- 

 I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes also. 
said Professor McGonagall. If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop 
you. But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us 
within this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill. 

 Minerva! he said, aghast. 

 The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties, interrupted 
Professor McGonagall. Go and wake your students, Horace. 

 Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter. He and Luna stayed after Professor 
McGonagall, who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her 
wand. 

 Piertotum---oh, for heaven's sake, Filch, not now--- 

 The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting Students out of 
bed! Students in the corridors! 

 They're supposed to be you blithering idiot! shouted McGonagall. Now go 
and do something constructive! Find Peeves! 

 'P-Peeves? stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name before. 

 Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven't you been complaining about him for a 
quarter of a century? Go and fetch him, at once. 

 Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her senses, but 
hobbled away, hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath. 

 And now---Piertotum Locomator! cried Professor McGonagall. And all along 
the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths, and from the 
echoing crashes from the floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows 
throughout the castle had done the same. 

 Hogwarts is threatened! shouted Professor McGonagall. Man the boundaries, 
protect us, do your duty to our school! 

 Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry, some of 
them smaller, others larger than life. There were animals too, and the clanking suits of 
armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains. 

 Now, Potter, said McGonagall., you and Miss Lovegood had better return to 
your friends and bring them to the Great Hall --- I shall rouse the other Gryffindors. 

 They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna turning back toward 
the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they met crowds of 


students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to the 
Great Hall by teachers and prefects. 

 That was Potter! 

 Harry Potter! 

 It was him, I swear, I just saw him! 

 But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of 
Requirement, Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to admit them, and 
he and Luna sped back down the steep staircase. 

 Wh--? 

 As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It was 
packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley and Lupin were 
looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia 
Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. 

 Harry, what's happening? said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the stairs. 

 Voldemort's on his way, they're barricading he school---Snape's run for it---What 
are you doing here? How did you know? 

 We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore's Army, Fred explained. You 
couldn't expect everyone to miss the fun, Harry, and the D.A. let the Order of the Phoenix 
know, and it all kind of snowballed. 

 What first, Harry? called George. What's going on? 

 They're evacuating the younger kids and everyone's meeting in the Great Hall to 
get organized, Harry said. We're fighting. 

 There was a great roar and a surge toward the stairs, he was pressed back against 
he wall as they ran past hi, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, 
Dumbledore's Army, and Harry's old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, 
heading up into the main castle. 

 Come on, Luna, Dean called as he passed, holding out his free hand, she took it 
and followed him back up the stairs. 

 The crowd was thinning. Only a little knot of people remained below in the 
Room of Requirement, and Harry joine3d them. Mrs. Weasley was struggling with 
Ginny. Around them stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill and Fleur. 

 You're underage! Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry approached 
I won't permit it! The boys, yes, but you, you've got to go home! 

 I won't! 

 Ginny's hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother's grip. 

 I'm in Dumbledore's Army--- 

 A teenagers' gang! 

 A teenagers' gang that's about to take him on, which no one else has dared to 
do! said Fred. 

 She's sixteen! shouted Mrs. Weasley. She's not old enough! What you two 
were thinking bringing her with you- 

 Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves. 

 Mom's right, Ginny, said Bill gently. You can't do this. Everyone underage 
will have to leave, it's only right. 

 I can't go home! Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her eyes. my whole 
family's here, I can't stand waiting there alone and not knowing and -- 


 Her eyes met Harry's for the first time. She looked at him beseechingly, but he 
shook his head and she turned away bitterly. 

 Fine, she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hog's Head. I'll 
say good-by now, then, and--- 

 There was a scuffling and a great thump. Someone else had clambered out of the 
tunnel, overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself up no the nearest chair, 
looked around through lopsided horn-rimmed glasses, and said, Am I too late? Has it 
started. I only just found out, so I --- I --- 

 Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run into most of 
his family. There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur turning to Lupin 
and saying, in a wildly transparent attempt to break the tension. So--- 'ow eez leetle 
Teddy? 

 Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the Weasleys seemed to be 
solidifying, like ice. 

 I --- oh yes--- he's fine! Lupin said loudly. yes, Tonks is with him--- at her 
mother's --- 

 Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another, frozen. 

 Here, I've got a picture? Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph from inside his 
jacket and showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright 
turquoise hair, waving fat fists at the camera. 

 I was a fool! Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his photograph. 
I was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a C a -- 

 Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron, said Fred. 

 Percy swallowed. 

 Yes, I was! 

 Well, you can't say fairer than that, said Fred, holding his hand out to Percy. 

 Mrs. Weasley burst into tears,. She ran forward, pushed Fred aside, and pulled 
Percy into a strangling hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes on his father. 

 I'm sorry, Dad, Percy said. 

 Mr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug his son. 

 What made you see sense, Perce? inquired George. 

 It's been coming on for a while, said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses 
with a corner of his traveling cloak. But I had to find a way out and it's not so easy at 
the Ministry, they're imprisoning traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with 
Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight 
of it, so here I am. 

 Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these, said 
George in a good imitation of Percy's most pompous manner. Now let's get upstairs and 
fight, or all the good Death Eaters'll be taken. 

 So, you're my sister in-law now? Said Percy, shaking hands with Fleur as they 
hurried off toward the staircase with Bill, Fred, and George. 

 Ginny! barked Mrs. Weasley. 

 Ginny had been attempting, under cover of the reconciliations to sneak upstairs 
too. 


 Molly, how about this, said Lupin. Why doesn't Ginny stay here , then at least 
she'll be on the scene and know what's going on, but she won't be in the middle of the 
fighting? 

 I--- 

 That's a good idea, said Mr. Weasley firmly,  Ginny, you stay in this room, 
you hear me? 

 Ginny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father's unusually stern 
gaze, she nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin headed off to the stairs as well. 

 Where's Ron? asked Harry, Where's Hermione? 

 They must have gone up the Great Hall already, Mr. Weasley called over his 
shoulder. 

  I didn't see them pass me, said Harry. 

 They said something about a bathroom, said Ginny, not long after you left. 

 A bathroom? 

 Harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of 
Requirement and checked the bathroom beyond. It was empty. 

 You're sure they said bath---? 

 But then his scar seared and the Room of Req1uirement vanished. He was 
looking through the high wrought-iron gates with winged boats on pillars at either side, 
looking through the dark grounds toward the castle, which was ablaze with lights. Nagini 
lay draped over his shoulders. He was possessed of that cold, cruel sense of purpose that 
preceded murder. 

 

Chapter Thirty-One 

The Battle of Hogwarts 

 

The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and 
below it the four long House tables were lined with disheveled students, some in 
traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and there shone the pearly white figures 
of the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, 
who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood the 
remaining teaches, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the 
Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight. 

 

 "...evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madame Pomfrey. Prefects, 
when I give the word, you will organize your House and take your charges in orderly 
fashion to the evacuation point. 

 

 Many of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted the walls, 
scanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the 
Hufflepuff table and shouted; "And what if we want to stay and fight?" 

 

 There was a smattering of applause. 

 


 "If you are of age, you may stay." said Professor McGonagall. 

 

 "What about our things?" called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. "Our trunks, our 
owls?" 

 

 "We have no time to collect possessions." said Professor McGonagall. "The 
important thing is to get you out of here safely." 

 

 "Where's Professor Snape?" shouted a girl from the Slytherin table. 

 

 "He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk." replied Professor McGonagall 
and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws. 

 

 Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for Ron and 
Hermione. As he passed, faces turned in his direction, and a great deal of whispering 
broke out in his wake. 

 

 "We have already placed protection around the castle," Professor McGonagall 
was saying, "but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, 
therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects -" 

 

 But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Hall. 
It was high, cold, and clear. There was no telling from where it came. It seemed to issue 
from the walls themselves. Like the monster it had once commanded, it might have lain 
dormant there for centuries. 

 

 "I know that you are preparing to fight." There were screams amongst the 
students, some of whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for the source of 
the sound. "Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I 
have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood." 

 

 There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the 
eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls. 

 

 "Give me Harry Potter," said Voldemort's voice, "and they shall not be harmed. 
Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter and 
you will be rewarded. 

 

 "You have until midnight." 

 

 The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place 
seemed to have found Harry, to hold him forever in the glare of thousands of invisible 
beams. Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as 
she raised a shaking arm and screamed, "But he's there! Potter's there. Someone grab 
him!" 

 


 Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in 
front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the 
Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their 
backs to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and 
overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and from 
under sleeves. 

 

 "Thank you, Miss Parkinson." said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. 
"You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow." 

 

 Harry heard the grinding of the benches and then the sound of the Slytherins 
trooping out on the other side of the Hall. 

 

 "Ravenclaws, follow on!" cried Professor McGonagall. 

 

 Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but 
a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more 
Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating 
Professor McGonagall's descent from the teachers' platform to chivvy the underage on 
their way. 

 

 "Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!" 

 

 Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor table. 

 

 "Where are Ron and Hermione?" 

 

 "Haven't you found -?" began Mr. Weasley, looking worried. 

 

 But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to 
address those who had remained behind. 

 

 "We've only got half an half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast. A 
battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the 
Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout and McGonagall are going to take groups of 
fighters up to the three highest towers - Ravenclaw, Astronomy, and Gryffindor - where 
they'll have good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells. Meanwhile 
Remus" - he indicated Lupin - "Arthur" - he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, sitting at the 
Gryffindor table - "and I will take groups into the grounds. We'll need somebody to 
organize defense of the entrances or the passageways into the school -" 

 

 "Sounds like a job for us." called Fred, indicating himself and George, and 
Kingsley nodded his approval. 

 

 "All right, leaders up here and we'll divide up the troops!" 

 


 "Potter," said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students flooded the 
platform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, "Aren't you supposed to be looking 
for something?" 

 

 "What? Oh," said Harry, "oh yeah!" 

 

 He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the battle was 
being fought so that he could search for it: The inexplicable absence of Ron and 
Hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind. 

 

 "Then go, Potter, go!" 

 

 "Right - yeah -" 

 

 He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into the 
entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up 
the marble staircase with them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. 
Fear and panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to 
concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly 
as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not 
seem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along a passage, 
where he sat down on the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder's Map out 
of the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron's of Hermione's names anywhere on 
it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of 
Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his 
hands over his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. 

 

 Voldemort thought I'd go to Ravenclaw Tower. 

 

 There it was, a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed Alecto 
Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could be only one explanation; 
Voldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux was connected to that House. 

 

 But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost 
diadem... and how could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that 
Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had eluded generations of 
Ravenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem 
in living memory? 

 

 In living memory... 

 

 Beneath his fingers, Harry's eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the plinth 
and tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. The sound of 
hundreds of people marching toward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder 
as he returned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep 
track of the students in their own houses, there was much pushing and shouting; Harry 


saw Zacharias Smith bowling over first years to get to the front of the queue, here and 
there younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or 
siblings. 

 

 Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below 
and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor. 

 

 "Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!" 

 

 He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the bottom 
of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for 
him. 

 

 "Harry! My dear boy!" 

 

 Nick made to grasp Harry's hands with both of his own; Harry felt as though they 
had been thrust into icy water. 

 

 "Nick, you've got to help me. Who's the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?" 

 

 Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended. 

 

 "The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require -?" 

 

 "It's got to be her - d'you know where she is?" 

 

 "Let's see..." 

 

 Nick's head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering 
over the heads of the swarming students. 

 

 "That's her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair." 

 

 Harry looked in the direction of Nick's transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall 
ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away 
through a solid wall. 

 

 Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she had 
disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from 
him. 

 

 "hey - wait - come back!" 

 

 She consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground. Harry supposed 
that she was beautiful, with her waist-length hair and floor-length cloak, but she also 


looked haughty and proud. Close in, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several 
times in the corridor, but to whom he had never spoken. 

 

 "You're the Gray Lady?" 

 

 She nodded but did not speak. 

 

 "The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?" 

 

 "That is correct." 

 

 Her tone was not encouraging. 

 

 "Please, I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost 
diadem." 

 

 A cold smile curved her lips. 

 

 "I am afraid," she said, turning to leave, "that I cannot help you." 

 

 "WAIT!" 

 

 He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm 
him. He glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him. It was a quarter to midnight. 

 

 "This is urgent." he said fiercely. "If that diadem's at Hogwarts, I've got to find it, 
fast." 

 

 "You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem." she said disdainfully. 
"Generations of students have badgered me -" 

 

 "This isn't about trying to get better marks!" Harry shouted at her, "It's about 
Voldemort - defeating Voldemort - or aren't you interested in that?" 

 

 She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and her 
voice was heated as she replied, "Of course I - how dare you suggest -?" 

 

 "Well, help me then!" 

 

 Her composure was slipping. 

 

 "It - it is not a question of -" she stammered. My mother's diadem -" 

 

 "Your mother's?" 

 

 She looked angry with herself. 


 

 "When I lived," she said stiffly, "I was Helena Ravenclaw." 

 

 "You're her daughter? But then, you must know what happed to it." 

 

 

 "While the diadem bestows wisdom," she said with an obvious effort to pull 
herself together, "I doubt that it would greatly increase you chances of defeating the 
wizard who calls himself Lord -" 

 

 Haven't I told you, I'm not interested in wearing it!" Harry said fiercely. "There's 
no time to explain - but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort 
finished, you've got to tell me anything you know about the diadem!" 

 

 She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at him, and a sense of 
hopelessness engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had known anything, she would have told 
Flitwick of Dumbledore, who had surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his 
head and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice. 

 

 "I stole the diadem from my mother." 

 

 "You - you did what?" 

 

 "I stole the diadem." repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper. "I sought to make 
myself cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with it." 

 

 He did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence and did not ask, he 
simply listened, hard, as she went on. 

 

 "My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but pretended 
that she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal, even from the other 
founders of Hogwarts. 

 

 "Then my mother fell ill - fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she was desperate to 
see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned his 
advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so." 

 

 Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head. 

 

 "He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return with 
him, he became violent. The baron was always a hot-tempered man. Furious at my 
refusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me." 

 

 "The Baron? You mean -?" 

 


 "he Bloody Baron, yes," said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she 
wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest. When he saw what he had done, 
he was overcome with remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used 
it to kill himself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence ... as 
he should." she added bitterly. 

 

 "And - and the diadem?" 

 

 "It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the 
forest toward me. Concealed inside a hollow tree." 

 

 "A hollow tree?" repeated Harry. "What tree? Where was this?" 

 

 "A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother's 
reach." 

 

 "Albania," repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously from confusion, 
and now he understood why she was telling him what she had denied Dumbledore and 
Flitwick. "You've already told someone this story, haven't you? Another student?" 

 

 She closed her eyes and nodded. 

 

 "I had... no idea... He was flattering. He seemed to... understand... to 
sympathize..." 

 

 Yes, Harry thought. Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena 
Ravenclaw's desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right. 

 

 "Well, you weren't the first person Riddle wormed things out of." Harry muttered. 
"He could be charming when he wanted..." 

 

 So, Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out of the 
Gray Lady. He had traveled to that far-flung forest and retrieved the diadem from its 
hiding place, perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts, before he even started work at Borgin 
and Burkes. 

 

 And wouldn't those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge 
when, so much later, Voldemort and needed a place to lie low, undisturbed, for ten long 
years? 

 

 But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not been left in that 
lowly tree. . . . No, the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home, and Voldemort 
must have put it there C 

 the night he asked for a job! said Harry, finishing his thought. 

 I beg your pardon? 


 He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him 
teach! said Harry. Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all. He mustve 
hidden the diadem on his way up to, or down from, Dumbledores office! But it was well 
worth trying to get the job C then he mightve got the chance to nick Gryffindors sword 
as well C thank you, thanks! 

 Harry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered. As he rounded the corner 
back into the entrance hall, he checked his watch. It was five minutes until midnight, and 
though he now knew what the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering where it 
was. . . 

 Generations of students had failed to find the diadem; that suggested that it was 
not in Ravenclaw Tower C but if not there, where? What hiding place had Tom Riddle 
discovered inside Hogwarts Castle, that he believed would remain secret forever? 

 Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few 
steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, 
shattering crash. As he leapt aside, a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit 
the opposite wall. 

Something large and furry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung 
itself at Harry. 

 Hagrid! Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhounds attentions as the 
enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet What the --? 

 Harry, yer here! Yer here! 

 Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib-cracking hug, then 
ran back to the shattered window. 

 Good boy, Grawpy! he bellowed through the hole in the window. Ill se yer in 
a moment, theres a good lad! 

 Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light in the distance and 
heard a weird, keening scream. He looked down at his watch: It was midnight. The battle 
had begun. 

 Blimey, Harry, panted Hagrid, this is it, eh? Time ter fight? 

 Hagrid, where have you come from? 

 Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave, said Hagrid grimly. Voice carried, 
didnt it? Yet got till midnight ter gimme Potter. Knew yeh mus be here, knew that 
mus be happenin. Get down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an Grawpy an Fang. 
Smashed our way through the boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin us, Fang an 
me. Told him ter let me down at the castle, so he shoved me through the window, bless 
him. Not exactly what I meant, bu C wheres Ron an Hermione? 

 That, said Harry, is a really good question. Come on. 

 They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping beside them. Harry could 
hear movement through the corridors all around: running footsteps, shouts; through the 
windows, he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds. 

 Wherere we goin? puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harrys heels, making 
the floorboards quake. 

 I dunno exactly, said Harry, making another random turn, but Ron and 
Hermione must be around here somewhere. . . . 

 The first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead: 
The two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been 


smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another broken window. Their remains 
stirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads, it 
moaned faintly. Oh, dont mind me . . . Ill just be here and crumble. . . . 

 Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of Rowena 
Ravenclaw at Xenophiliuss house, wearing that mad headdress C and then of the statue 
in Ravenclaw Tower, with the stone diadem upon her white curls. . . . 

 And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone effigy 
came back to him: that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry himself had 
placed a wig and a battered old hat. The shock shot through Harry with the heat of 
firewhisky, and he nearly stumbled. 

 He knew, at least, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him. . . . 

 Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been 
arrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of 
Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set 
foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his time at 
school C here at least was a secret area he and Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had 
never discovered C 

 He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by Neville 
and half a dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be 
large potted plants. 

 Mandrakes! Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran. Going to 
lob them over the walls C they wont like this! 

 Harry knew now where to go. He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang galloping 
behind him. They passed portrait after portrait, and the painted figures raced alongside 
them, wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches, in armor and cloaks, cramming 
themselves into each others canvases, screaming news from other parts of the castle. As 
they reached the end of this corridor, the whole castle shook, and Harry knew, as a 
gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force, that it was in the grip of 
enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the Order. 

 Its all righ, Fang C its all righ! yelled Hagrid, but the great boarhound had 
taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air, and Hagrid pounded off 
after the terrified dog, leaving Harry alone. 

 He forged on through the trembling passages, his wand at the ready, and for the 
length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadrigan, rushed from painting to 
painting beside him, clanking along in his armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little 
pony cantering behind him. 

 Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out, Harry Potter, see 
them off! 

 Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, 
including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty plinth, whose 
statue had concealed a secret passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were 
listening at the concealed hole. 

 Nice night for it! Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and Harry sprinted by, 
elated and terrified in equal measure. Along yet another corridor he dashed, and then 
there were owls everywhere, and Mrs. Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her 
paws, no doubt to return them to their proper place. . . . 


 Potter! 

 Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his wand held ready. 

 Ive had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter! 
I know, were evacuating, Harry said, Voldemorts C 

 C attacking because they havent handed you over, yeah, said Aberforth. Im 
not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never occurred to any of you to keep 
a few Slytherins hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters youve just sent to safety. 
Wouldnt it have been a bit smarter to keep em here? 
It wouldnt stop Voldemort, said Harry, and your brother would never have 
done it. 
Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction. 

 Your brother would never have done it. . . . Well, it was the truth, Harry thought 
as he ran on again: Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so long, would never have 
held students ransom. . . . 

 And then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and 
fury he saw them: Ron and Hermione; both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty 
yellow objects, Ron with a broomstick under his arms. 

 Where the hell have you been? Harry shouted. 

 Chamber of Secrets, said Ron. 

 Chamber C what? said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them. 

 It was Ron, all Rons idea! said Hermione breathlessly. Wasnt it absolutely 
brilliant? There we were, after we left, and I said to Ron, even if we find the other one, 
how are we going to get rid of it? We still hadnt got rid of the cup! And then he thought 
of it! The basilisk! 

 What the C ? 

 Something to get rid of Horcruxes, said Ron simply. 

 Harrys eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermiones arms: great 
curved fangs; torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk. 

 But how did you get in there? he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron. You 
need to speak Parseltongue! 
He did! whispered Hermione. Show him, Ron! 
Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise. 

 Its what you did to open the locket, he told Harry apologetically. I had to have 
a few goes to get it right, but, he shrugged modestly, we got there in the end. 
He was amazing! said Hermione. Amazing! 

 So . . . Harry was struggling to keep up. So . . . 

 So were another Horcrux down, said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled 
the mangled remains of Hufflepuffs cup. Hermione stabbed it. Thought she should. She 
hasnt had the pleasure yet. 
Genius! yelled Harry. 

 It was nothing, said Ron, though he looked delighted with himself. So whats 
new with you? 

 As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: All three of them looked up 
as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream. 

 I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is, said Harry, talking 
fast. He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyones been hiding 


stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on. 
As the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through the concealed 
entrance and down the staircase into the Room of Requirement. It was empty except for 
three women: Ginny, Tonks and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry 
recognized immediately as Nevilles grandmother. 

 Ah, Potter, she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him. You can tell us 
whats going on. 
Is everyone okay? said Ginny and Tonks together. 

 S far as we know, said Harry. Are there still people in the passage to the 
Hogs Head? 

 He knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users 
inside it. 

 I was the last to come through, said Mrs. Longbottom. I sealed it, I think it 
unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson? 

 Hes fighting, said Harry. 

 Naturally, said the old lady proudly. Excuse me, I must go and assist him. 
With surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps. 

 Harry looked at Tonks. 

 I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mothers? 
I couldnt stand not knowing C Tonks looked anguished. Shell look after him 
C have you seen Remus? 
He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds C 

 Without another word, Tonks sped off. 

 Ginny, said Harry, Im sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a bit. Then 
you can come back in. 

 Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary. 

 And then you can come back in! he shouted after her as she ran up the steps 
after Tonks. Youve got to come back in! 

 Hang on a moment! said Ron sharply. Weve forgotten someone! 
Who? asked Hermione. 

 The house-elves, theyll all be down in the kitchen, wont they? 
You mean we ought to get them fighting? asked Harry. 

 No, said Ron seriously, I mean we should tell them to get out. We dont want 
anymore Dobbies, do we? We cant order them to die for us C 

 There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermiones arms. 
Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron 
threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such 
enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet. 

 Is this the moment? Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except 
that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he 
raised his voice. Oi! Theres a war going on here! 
Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. 

 I know, mate, said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the 
back of the head with a Bludger, so its now or never, isnt it? 

 Never mind that, what about the Horcrux? Harry shouted. Dyou think you 
could just C just hold it in until weve got the diadem? 


 Yeah C right C sorry C said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up 
fangs, both pink in the face. 

 It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in 
the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the 
castle had deteriorated severely: The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; 
dust filled the air, and through the nearest window, Harry saw bursts of green and red 
light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very near to 
entering the place. Looking down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging 
what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure. 

 Lets hope he steps on some of them! said Ron as more screams echoed from 
close by. 

 As long as its not any of our lot! said a voice: Harry turned and saw Ginny and 
Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next window, which was missing several 
panes. Even as he watched, Ginny sent a well-aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below. 

 Good girl! roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and Harry saw 
Aberforth again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past. They look 
like they might be breaching the north battlements, theyve brought giants of their own. 

 Have you seen Remus? Tonks called after him. 

 He was dueling Dolohov, shouted Aberforth, havent seen him since! 
Tonks, said Ginny, Tonks, Im sure hes okay C 

 But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth. 

 Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 

 Theyll be all right, said Harry, though he knew they were empty words. 
Ginny, well be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe C come on! he 
said to Ron and Hermione, and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the 
Room of Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant. 

 I need the place where everything is hidden. Harry begged of it inside his head, 
and the door materialized on their third run past. 

 The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the 
door behind them: All was silent. They were in a place the size of a cathedral with the 
appearance of a city, its towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of long-gone 
students. 

 And he never realized anyone could get in? said Ron, his voice echoing in the 
silence. 

 He thought he was the only one, said Harry. Too bad for him Ive had to hide 
stuff in my time . . . this way, he added. I think its down here. . . . 
They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others footsteps echoing 
through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, 
broomsticks, bats. . . . 

 Somewhere near here, Harry muttered to himself. Somewhere . . . 
somewhere . . . 

 Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he recognized 
from his one previous trip into the room. His breath was loud in his ears, and then his 
very soul seemed to shiver. There it was, right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which 
he had hidden his old Potions book, and on top of it, the pockmarked stone warlock 
wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient discolored tiara. 


 He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained few feet away, when a 
voice behind him said, Hold it, Potter. 

 He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind 
him, shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through the small space 
between their jeering faces he saw Draco Malfoy. 

 Thats my wand youre holding, Potter, said Malfoy, pointing his own through 
the gap between Crabbe and Goyle. 

 Not anymore, panted Harry, tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand. 
Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Whos lent you theirs? 

 My mother, said Draco. 

 Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the situation. He 
could not hear Ron or Hermione anymore. They seemed to have run out of earshot, 
searching for the diadem. 

 So how come you three arent with Voldemort? asked Harry. 

 Were gonna be rewarded, said Crabbe. His voice was surprisingly soft for such 
an enormous person: Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before. Crabbe was speaking 
like a small child promised a large bag of sweets. We ung back, Potter. We decided not 
to go. Decided to bring you to im. 

 Good plan, said Harry in mock admiration. He could not believe that he was 
this close, and was going to be thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He began edging 
slowly backward toward the place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he 
could just get his hands on it before the fight broke out . . . 

 So how did you get in here? he asked, trying to distract them. 

I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year, said Malfoy, his 
voice brittle. I know how to get in. 

We was hiding in the corridor outside, grunted Goyle. We can do Diss-lusion 
Charms now! And then, his face split into a gormless grin, you turned up right in front 
of us and said you was looking for a die-dum! Whats a die-dum? 

Harry? Rons voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harrys 
right. Are you talking to someone? 

With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty foot mountain of 
old furniture, of broken trunks, of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk, and 
shouted, Descendo! 

The wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door 
where Ron stood. 

Ron! Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione screamed, and 
Harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized 
wall: He pointed his wand at the rampart, cried, Finite! and it steadied. 

No! shouted Malfoy, staying Crabbes arm as the latter made to repeat his spell. 
If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing! 

Whats that matter? said Crabbe, tugging himself free. Its Potter the Dark 
Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum? 

Potter came in here to get it, said Malfoy with ill-disguised impatience at the 
slow-wittedness of his colleagues. so that must mean C 

Must mean? Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity. Who cares 
what you think? I dont take your orders no more, Draco. You an your dad are finished. 


Harry? shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk wad. Whats going 
on? 

Harry? mimicked Crabbe. Whats going on C no, Potter! Crucio! 

Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbes curse missed him but hit the stone bust, 
which flew into the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the 
mass of objects on which the bust had rested. 

STOP! Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous 
room. The Dark Lord wants him alive C 

So? Im not killing him, am I? yelled Crabbe, throwing off Malfoys restraining 
arm. But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, whats the diff C ? 

A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run around the 
corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbes head. It only missed 
because Malfoy pulled him out of the way. 

Its that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra! 

Harry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to kill wiped 
all else from his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, 
knocking Malfoys wand out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of 
broken furniture and bones. 

Dont kill him! DONT KILL HIM! Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and Goyle, who 
were both aiming at Harry: Their split seconds hesitation was all Harry needed. 

Expelliarmus! 

Goyles wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects 
beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of 
range of Hermiones second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of 
the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed. 

Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, Avada Kedavra! again. Ron leapt out of 
sight to avoid the jet of green light. The wand-less Malfoy cowered behind a three-legged 
wardrobe as Hermione charged toward them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she 
came. 

Its somewhere here! Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk into which 
the old tiara had fallen. Look for it while I go and help R C 

HARRY! she screamed. 

A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moments warning. He turned 
and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them. 

Like it hot, scum? roared Crabbe as he ran. 

But he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of abnormal size 
were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to 
soot at their touch. 

Aguamenti! Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his 
wand evaporated in the air. 

RUN! 

Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe outstripped all 
of them, now looking terrified; Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and 
the fire pursued them. It was not normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had 
no knowledge. As they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, 
sentient, intent upon killing them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of 


fiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and 
the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up into the air into their 
fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno. 

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron and Hermione 
stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and 
horns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them. 

What can we do? Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. 
What can we do? 

Here! 

Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk 
and threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his leg 
over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up in the air, 
missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The 
smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was 
consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a 
thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in 
the room. Harry couldnot see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere. He swooped 
as low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them, but there was 
nothing but fire: What a terrible way to die. . . . He had never wanted this. . . . 

Harry, lets get out, lets get out! bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see 
where the door was through the black smoke. 

And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible 
commotion, the thunder of devouring flame. 

Its C too C dangerous C ! Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His glasses 
giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke, he raked the firestorm below, 
seeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood. . . . 

And he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair 
of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. Malfoy saw him 
coming and raised one arm, but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no 
good. Goyle was too heavy and Malfoys hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of 
Harrys C 

IF WE DIE FOR THEM, ILL KILL YOU, HARRY! roared Rons voice, and, 
as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto 
their broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up 
behind Harry. 

The door, get to the door, the door! screamed Malfoy in Harrys ear, and Harry 
sped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly 
able to breathe: and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring 
flames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in 
celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara C 

What are you doing, what are you doing, the doors that way! screamed Malfoy, 
but Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, 
turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he 
had it, caught it around his wrist C 

Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and straight 
toward the place where, he prayed, the door stood open; Ron, Hermione and Goyle had 


vanished; Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the 
smoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and 
moments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor 
beyond. 

Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retching. 
Harry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and 
Ron and Hermione sat panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious. 

C-Crabbe, choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. C-Crabbe . . . 

Hes dead, said Ron harshly. 

There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge 
bangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on 
horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet 
when the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was still going on all 
around him. He could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared 
within him. 

Wheres Ginny? he said sharply. She was here. She was supposed to be going 
back into the Room of Requirement. 

Blimey, dyou reckon itll still work after that fire? asked Ron, but he too got to 
his feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right. Shall we split up and look C ? 

No, said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle remained 
slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor; neither of them had wands. Lets stick 
together. I say we go C Harry, whats that on your arm? 

What? Oh yeah C 

He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with 
soot, but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched 
upon it; WIT BEYOND MEASURE IS MANS GREATEST TREASURE. 

A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the diadem. 
Suddenly Harry felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in his hands, and as it did 
so, he thought he heard the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the 
grounds or the castle, but from the thing that had just fragmented in his fingers. 

It must have been Fiendfyre! whimpered Hermione, her eyes on the broken 
piece. 

Sorry? 

Fiendfyre C cursed fire C its one of the substances that destroy Horcruxes, but I 
would never, ever have dared use it, its so dangerous C how did Crabbe know how to C 
? 

Mustve learned from the Carrows, said Harry grimly. 

Shame he wasnt concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, really, said 
Ron, whose hair, like Hermiones, was singed, and whose face was blackened. If he 
hadnt tried to kill us all, Id be quite sorry he was dead. 

But dont you realize? whispered Hermione. This means, if we can just get the 
snake C 

But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled 
the corridor. Harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail: Death Eaters had 
penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and Percy had just backed into view, both of them dueling 
masked and hooded men. 


Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of light flew in every 
direction and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast: Then his hood slipped and they saw 
a high forehead and streaked hair C 

Hello, Minister! bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who 
dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. 
Did I mention Im resigning? 

Youre joking, Perce! shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed 
under the weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground 
with tiny spikes erupting all over him; he seemed to be turning into some form of sea 
urchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee. 

You actually are joking, Perce. . . . I dont think Ive heard you joke since you 
were C 

The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, 
and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in 
that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent 
apart, Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as 
possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head 
in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing 
what had happened to them C 

And then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness: He was half buried 
in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told 
him that the side of the castle had been blown away, and hot stickiness on his cheek told 
him that he was bleeding copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, 
that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause, and he stood up, 
swaying, more frightened than he had been that day, more frightened, perhaps, than he 
had been in his life. . . . 

And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and three redheaded 
men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart. Harry grabbed 
Hermiones hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood. 

No C no C no! someone was shouting. No! Fred! No! 

And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Freds eyes 
stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face. 


 

 

Chapter Thirty-Two 

The Elder Wand 

 
The world had ended, so why had the battle not ceased, the castle 
fallen silent in horror, and every combatant laid down their arms? 
Harry's mind was in free fall, spinning out of control, unable to 
grasp the impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be dead, 
the evidence of all his senses must be lying-- 
And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the 


school and curses flew in at them from the darkness, hitting the 
wall behind their heads. 
"Get down!" Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night: 
He and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, 
but Percy lay across Fred's body, shielding it from further harrm, 
and when Harry shouted "Percy, come on, we've got to move!" he 
shook his head. 
"Percy!" Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating ron's 
face as he sezied his elder brother's shoulders and pulled, but 
Percy would not budge. "Percy, you can't do anything for him! We're 
going to--" 
Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A 
monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb 
through the huge hole in the wall. one of Aragog's descendants had 
joined the fight. 
Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the 
monster was blown backward, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished 
into the darkness. 
"It brought friends!" Harry called to the others, glancing over the 
edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had 
blasted. More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, 
liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters 
must have penetrated. Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon them, 
knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled 
back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came 
soaring over Harry's head, so close he felt the force of them blow 
his hair. 
"Let's move, NOW!" 
Pushing Hermione ahead of him with ron, Harry stooped to seize 
Fred's body under the armpit. Percy, realizing what Harry was 
trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped: together, 
crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, 
they hauled Fred out of the way. 
"Here," said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of 
armor had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a second 
longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body was well- 
hidden, he took off after ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had 
vanished but at the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust 
and falling masonry, glass long gone from windows, he saw many 
people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes he 
could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like 
roar: "ROOKWOOD!" and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, 
who was pursuing a couple of students. 
"Harry, in here!" Hermione screamed. 
She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry. They seemed to be wrestling 
together, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were 


embracing again; then hhe saw that Hermione was trying to restrain 
Ron, to stop him running after Percy. 
"Listen to me--LISTEN RON!" 
"I wanna help--I wanna kill Death Eaters--" 
His face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was 
shaking with rage and grief. 
"ron, we're the only ones who can end it! Please--ron--we need the 
snake, we've got to kill the snake!" said Hermione. 
But Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not 
bring the satisfaction of revenge; he too wanted to fight, to 
punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to find 
the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that 
Ginny was not--but he could not permit that idea to form in his 
mind-- 
"We will fight!" Hermione said. "We'll have to, to reach the snake! 
But let's not lose sight now of what we're supposed to be d-doing! 
We're the only ones who can end it!" 
She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed 
sleeve as she spoke, but she took great heaving breaths to calm 
herself as, still keeping a tight hold on ron, she turned to Harry. 
"You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he'll have the 
snake with him, won't he? Do it, Harry--look inside him!" 
Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, 
yearning to show him Voldemort's thoughts? He closed his eyes on 
her command, and at once, the screams and bangs and all the 
discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became 
distant, as though he stood far, far away from them... 
He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar 
room, with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded 
up except for one. The sounds of the assault on the castle were 
muffled and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant 
bursts of light where the castle stood, but inside the room was 
dark except for a solitary oil lamp. 
He was rolling his wand between his figners, watching it, his 
thoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he had 
ever found, the room, like the chamber, that you had to be clever 
and cunning and inquisitive to discover...He was confident that the 
boy would not find the diadem...although Dumbledore's puppet had 
come much farther than he ever expected...too far... 
"My Lord," said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned: there 
was Lucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still 
bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boy's 
last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. "My 
Lord...please...my son..." 
"If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come 
and join me, like the rest of the Slytherins. Perhaps he has 


decided to befriend Harry Potter?" 
"No--never," whispered Malfoy. 
"You must hope not." 
"Aren't--aren't you afraid, my Lord that Potter might die at 
another hand but yours?" asked Malfoy, his voice shaking. "Wouldn't 
it be...forgive me...more prudent to call off this battle, enter 
the castle, and seek him y-yourself?" 
"Do not pretend Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you 
can discover what has happened to your son. And i do not need to 
seek Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have come to find 
me." 
Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. It 
troubled him...and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed 
to be rearranged... 
"Go and fetch Snape." 
"Snape, m-my Lord?" 
"Snape. Now. I need him. There is a --service--I require from him. 
Go." 
Frightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left the 
room. Vodlemort continued to stand there, twirling the wand between 
his fingers, staring at it. 
"It is the only way, Nagini," he whispered, and he looked around, 
and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, 
twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had 
made for her, a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between a 
glittering cage and a tank. 
With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his yees at the same 
moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the 
smashes and bangs of battle. 
"He's in the Shrieking Shack. The snake's with him, it's got some 
sort of magical protection around it. He's just sent Lucius Malfoy 
to find Snape." 
"voldemort's sitting in the shrieking Shack?" said Hermione, 
outraged. "He's not--he's not even FIGHTING?" 
"He doesn't think he needs to fight," said Harry. "He thinks I'm 
going to go to him." 
"But why?" 
"He knows I'm after Horcruxes--he's keeping Nagini close beside him- 
-obviously I'm going to have to go to him to get near the thing--" 
"Right," said Ron, squaring his shoulders. "So you can't go, that's 
what he wants, what he's expecting. You stay here and look after 
Hermione, and I'll go and get it--" 
Harry cut across Ron. 
"You two stay here, I'll go under the Cloak and I'll be back as 
soon as I--" 
"No," said Hermione,, "it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak 


and--" 
"Don't even think about it," Ron snarled at her. 
before Hermione could get farther than "Ron, I'm just as capable -- 
" the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was 
ripped open. 
"POTTER!" 
Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands 
were fully raised, Hermione shouted "Glisseo!" 
The stairs beneath their feet flatteneed into a chute and she, 
Harry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but 
so fast that the Death Eaters' Stunning Spells flew far over their 
heads. They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and 
spun onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall. 
"Duro!" cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and 
there were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to 
stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it. 
"Get back!" shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione hurled 
themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered 
past, shepherdd by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She appeared 
not to notice them. Her hair had come down and there was a gash on 
her cheek. As she turned the corner, they heard her scream, 
"CHARGE!" 
"Harry, you get the Cloak on," said Hermione. "Never mind us--" 
But he threw it over all three of them; large though they were he 
doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust 
that clogged the air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells. 
they ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor 
full of duelers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were 
crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, while 
Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and 
teachers. Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with 
Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, ron and Hermione raised their 
wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and 
darting so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting on of 
their own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, 
looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great "Wheeeeee!" 
and looking up, Harry saw Peeves zoomign over them, dropping 
Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were 
suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. 
"ARGH!" 
A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron's head; the damp 
green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to 
shake them loose. 
"Someone's invisible there!" shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing. 
Dean made the most of the Death Eater's momentary distraction, 
knocking him out with a stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted to 


retaliate, and Parvati shot a Body Bind Curse at him. 
"LET'S GO!" Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the 
Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the 
midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff 
juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance 
hall. 
"I'm Draco Malfoy, I'm Draco, I'm on your side!" 
Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with anoter masked Death 
Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed. Malfoy looked 
around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the 
Cloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth 
bleeding, utterly bemused. 
"And that's the second time we've saved your life tonight, you two- 
faced bastard!" Ron yelled. 
There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall. Death 
Eaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, 
in combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley 
right beside them. Students ran in every direction; some carrying 
or dragging injured friends. Harry directed a Stunnning Spell 
toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, 
who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous 
Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death 
Eater and began reeling him in. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped won the marble staircase: glass 
shattered on the left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had 
recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that 
people slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the 
balcony overhead as they reached the ground a gray blur that Harry 
took for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its 
teeth into one of the fallen. 
"NO!" shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand, 
Fenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly struggling body 
of Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to 
return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a 
crystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground 
and did not move. 
"I have more!" shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the 
banisters. "More for any who want them! Here--" 
And with a move likea tennis serve, she heaved another enormous 
crystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and 
caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a 
window. At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst 
open, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the 
front hall. 
Screams of terror rent the air: the fighters scattered, Death 
Eaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew 


into the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and 
reared, more terrifying than ever. 
"How do we get out?" yelled ron over all the screaming, but before 
either Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside; 
Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery 
pink umbrella. 
"Don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em!" he yelled. 
"HAGRID, NO!" 
Harry forgot everything else: he sprinted out from under the cloak, 
running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall. 
"HAGRID, COME BACK!" 
But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid 
vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul 
swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, 
Hagrid buried in their midst. 
"HAGRID!" Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend 
or foe he did not care: He was springint down the front steps into 
the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their 
prey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all. 
"HAGRID!" 
He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the mdist 
of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way 
was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the 
darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked 
up: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its head ihidden in 
shadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light 
from the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed 
a massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon 
Harryk, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway. 
"Oh my--!" shrieked Hermione, as she and ron caught up with Harry 
and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through 
the window above. 
"DON'T!" ron yelled, grabbing Hermione's hand as she raised her 
wand. "Stun him and he'll crush half the castle--" 
"HAGGER?" 
Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only dnow did 
Harry realzie that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The 
gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors 
turned around and let out a rorar. The stone steps tremebled as he 
stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp's lopsided mouth fell 
open, showing yellow, half brick-sized teeth; and then they 
launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions. 
"RUN!" Harry roared; the ngiht was full of hideous yells and blows 
as the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione's hand and tore down 
the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not 
lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they 


were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short 
again. 
The air around them had frozen: Harry's breath caught and 
solidified in his chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling 
figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards 
the castles, their faces hooded and their breath rattling... 
ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting 
behind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only 
dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night, and 
Fred was gone, and Hagrid was suurely dying or already dead... 
"come on, Harry!" said Hermione's voice from a very long way away. 
"Patronuses, Harry, come on!" 
he raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading 
throughout him: How many more lay dead that he did not yet know 
about? He felt as though his soul had already half left his body.... 
"HARRY, COME ON!" screamed Hermione. 
A hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking 
their way closer to Harry's despair, which was like a promise of a 
feast... 
He saw Ron's silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and 
expire; he saw Hermione's otter twist in midair and fade, and his 
own wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming 
oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling... 
And then a silver hare, a boar, and fox soared past Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione's heads: the dementors fell back before the creatures' 
approach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to 
stand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast 
Patronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus. 
"That's right," said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in 
the Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the 
D.A., "That's right, Harry...come on think of something happy..." 
'something happy?" he said, his voice cracked. 
"We're all still here," she whispered, "we;re still fighting. Come 
on, now...." 
There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the 
greatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of 
Harry's wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors scattered 
in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the 
sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears. 
"Can't thank you enough," said ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, 
and Seamus "you just saved--" 
With a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came 
lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest, 
brandishing a club taller than any of them. 
"RUN!" Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling; They 
all scattered, and not a second too soon, for the next moment the 


creature's vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been 
standing. Harry looked round: ron and Hermione were following him, 
but the other three had vanished back into the battle. 
"Let's get out of range!" yelled Ron as the giant swung its club 
again and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds 
wehere bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the 
darkness. 
"The Whomping willow," said Harry, "go!" 
Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small 
space into which he could not look now: thoughts of Fred and 
Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in 
and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had 
to reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione 
said, the only way to end it-- 
He sprinted, half-believing he could outdistance death itself, 
ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, 
and the sound of hte lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking 
of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through 
grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran 
faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw 
the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its 
roots with whiplike, slashing branches. 
Panting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the willow's 
swiping branches, peering through the darkness toward its tick 
trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree 
that would paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out 
of breath that she could not speak. 
"How--how're we going to get in?" panted ron. "I can--see the palce- 
-if we jsut had--Crookshanks again--" 
"Crookshanks?" wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. 
"Are you a wizard, or what?" 
"Oh--right--yeah--" 
Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground 
and said "Winguardium Leviosa!" The twig flew up from the gruond, 
spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed 
directly at the trunk through the Willow's ominously swaying 
branches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once, the 
writhing tree became still. 
"Perfect!" panted Hermione. 
"Wait." 
For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle 
filled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, 
wanted him to come...Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap? 
But the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: the only 
way forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where 
Voldemort was, and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel... 


"Harry, we're coming, just get in there!" said Ron, pushing him 
forward. 
Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree's roots. 
It was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they 
had entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged: they had had to 
double up to move throuhgh it nearly four years previously; now 
there was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, his wand 
illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none 
came. They moved in silence, Harry's gaze fixed upon the swinging 
beam of the wand held in his fist. At last, the tunnel began to 
slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged 
at his ankle. 
"The Cloak!" she whispered. "Put the Cloak on!" 
He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth 
into his free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, 
murmered, "Nox," extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his 
hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, 
expecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear 
voice, see a flash of green light. 
and then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of 
them, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the 
endo fht etuunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old 
crate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up tot he 
opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall. 
The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirlign 
and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, 
starry sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. He could see 
the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a 
wand. 
Then Snape spoke, and Harry's heart lurched: Snape was inches away 
from where he crouched, hidden. 
"...my Lord, their resistance is crumbling--" 
"--and it is doing so without your help," said Voldemort in his 
high, clear voice. "Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do 
not think you will make much difference now. We are almost 
there...almost." 
"Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find 
him, my Lord. Please." 
Snape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping 
his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell 
that might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could 
not think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away 
his position... 
Voldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the 
flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly in 
the semidarkness. 


"I have a problem, Severus," said Voldemort softly. 
"My Lord?" said Snape. 
Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and 
precisely as a conductor's baton. 
"Why doesn't it work for me, Severus?" 
In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing 
slightly as it coiled and uncoiled--or was it Voldemort's sibilant 
sigh lingering on the air? 
"My--my lord?" said Snape blankly. "I do not understand. You--you 
have performed extraordinary magic with that wand." 
"No," said Voldemort. "I have performed my usual magic. I am 
extraordinary, but this wand...no. It has not revealed the wonders 
it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one 
I procured from Ollivander all those years ago." 
Voldemort's tone was musing, calm, but Harry's scar had begun to 
throb and pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could 
feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort. 
"No difference," said Voldemort again. 
Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face. He wondered 
whether Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to 
reassure his master. 
Voldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight of him 
for seconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, 
while the pain and fury mounted in Harry. 
"I have thought long and hard, Severus...do you know why I have 
called you back from battle?" 
And for a moment Harry saw Snape's profile. His eyes were fixed 
upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage. 
"No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter." 
"You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. 
He does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I knew his 
weakness you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the 
others struck down around him, knwoing that it is for him that it 
happens. He will want to stop it at any cost. He will come." 
"But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by someone other than 
yourself--"\ 
"My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. 
Capture Potter. Kill his friends--the more, the better--but do not 
kill him. 
"But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry 
Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable." 
"My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But--let me go and find 
the boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I can--" 
"I have told you, no!" said Voldemort, and Harry caught the lgint 
of red in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his 
cloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort's 


impatience in his burning scar. "My concern at the moment, Severus, 
is what will happen when I finally meet the boy!" 
"My Lord, there can be no question, surely--?" 
"--but there is a question, Severus. There is." 
Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he slid 
the Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape. 
"Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry 
Potter?" 
"I--I cannot answer that, my Lord." 
"Can't you?" 
The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry's head: he 
forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out 
in pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking 
into Snape's pale face. 
"My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except 
to kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under 
torture of the twin cores, told me to take another's wand. I did 
so, but Lucius's wand shattered upon meeting Potter's." 
"I--I have no explanation, my Lord." 
Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still 
fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere. 
"I sought a third wand, Severus. the Elder Wand, the Wand of 
Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took 
it from the grfave of Albus Dumbledore." 
And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape's face was like a 
death mask. it was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it 
was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes. 
"My Lord--let me go to the boy--" 
"all this long night when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat 
here," said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper, 
"wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it 
ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for 
its rightful owner...and I think I have the answer." 
Snape did not speak. 
"Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, 
Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret 
what must happen." 
"My Lord--" 
"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not 
its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed 
its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, 
Severus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine." 
"My Lord!" Snape protested, raising his wand. 
"It cannot be any other way," said Voldemort. "I must master the 
wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last." 
And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to 


Sanpe, who for a split second seemed to think he had been 
reprieved: but then Voldemort's intention became clear. The snake's 
cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do 
anything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, 
and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue. 
"Kill." 
There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape's face losing the 
little color it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as 
the snake's fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the 
enchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to 
the floor. 
"I regret it," said Voldemort coldly. 
He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was 
time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would 
now do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding 
the snake, which drifted upward, off snape, who fell sideways onto 
the floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort 
swept from the room without a backward glance, and the great 
serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere. 
Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes; He had 
drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in an effort not to shout 
out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and 
wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor. 
"Harry!" breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed 
his wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the 
air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he 
pulled himself up into the room. 
He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the 
dying man: he did not know what he felt as he saw Snape's white 
face, adn the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his 
neck. Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon 
the man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as he cried 
to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front of his 
robes and pulled him close. 
A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape's throat. 
"Take...it...Take...it..." 
Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, 
neither gas nor liquid, it gushed form his mouth and his ears and 
his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do-- 
A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hand 
by Hermione. Harry lfited the silvery substance into it with his 
wand. When the falsk was full to the brim, and Snape looked as 
though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry's robes 
slackened. 
"Look...at....me..." he whispered. 
The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in 


the depths of the dark pari seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, 
blank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and 
Snape moved no more. 

 

Chapter Thirty-Three 

The Princes Tale 

 

Harry remained kneeling at Snapes side, simply staring down at him, until quite 
suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped on his feet, the 
flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room. 

 Voldemorts voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry realized that 
he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of 
Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he 
stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away. 

 You have fought, said the high, cold voice, valiantly. Lord Voldemort knows 
how to value bravery. 

 Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all 
die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a 
loss and a waste. 

 Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately. 

 You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. 

 I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to 
die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. 
If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then 
battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find 
you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you 
from me. One hour. 

 Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry. 

 Dont listen to him, said Ron. 

 Itll be all right, said Hermione wildly. Lets C lets get back to the castle, if 
hes gone to the forest well need to think of a new plan C  

 She glanced at Snapes body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron 
followed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He 
did not know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason 
for which it had been done 

 They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry wondered 
whether Ron and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads as he could. 

 You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I 
shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden ForestOne hour 

 Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle (?). It could only 
be an hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them hurried toward the 
stone steps. A lone dog, the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There 
was no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker. 


 The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or 
screams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. 
Emeralds were still scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered 
wood. Part of the banisters had been blown away. 

 Where is everyone? whispered Hermione. 

 Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway. 

 The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in 
groups, their arms around each others necks. The injured were being treated upon the 
raised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the 
injured; his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand. 

 The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Freds body, 
because his family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was 
lying across Freds chest, her body shaking. Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears 
cascaded down his cheeks. 

 Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione 
approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, 
and Percy, who flung an arm around Rons shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved 
closer to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred. 
Remus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, 
enchanted ceiling. 

 The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled 
backward from the doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not bear to look at any 
of the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the 
Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in the first 
place, Fred might never have died 

 He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks He yearned not 
to feel He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming 
inside him 

 The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass 
mourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of 
Snapes last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle 
guarding the headmasters office. 

 Password? 

 Dumbledore! said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned 
to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind. 

 But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The portraits that 
hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained 
to see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the 
castle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on. 

 Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledores deserted frame, which hung directly 
behind the headmasters chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the 
cabinet where it had always been. Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snapes 
memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge. To escape into 
someone elses head would be a blessed relief Nothing that even Snape had left him 
could be worse than his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange, 


and without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this would 
assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived. 

 He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he 
straightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge 
chimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, 
and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was 
overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too short jeans, a 
shabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt. 

 Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, 
sallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the 
younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister. 

 Lily, dont do it! shrieked the elder of the two. 

 But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the 
air, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and 
instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through 
the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly. 

 Mummy told you not to! 

 Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, 
making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips. 

 Mummy said you werent allowed, Lily! 

 But Im fine, said Lily, still giggling. Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can 
do. 

 Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, 
though the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush 
behind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and 
disapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held 
out her palm. The flower sat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, 
many-lipped oyster. 

 Stop it! shrieked Petunia. 

 Its not hurting you, said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and 
threw it back to the ground. 

 Its not right, said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flowers flight to the 
ground and lingered upon it. How do you do it? she added, and there was definite 
longing in her voice. 

 Its obvious, isnt it? Snape could no longer contain himself, but had jumped 
out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but 
Lily, though clearly startled, remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his 
appearance. A dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily. 

 Whats obvious? asked Lily. 

 Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petunia, now 
hovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, I know what you are. 

 What do you mean? 

 Youreyoure a witch, whispered Snape. 

 She looked affronted. 

 Thats not a very nice thing to say to somebody! 

 She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister. 


 No! said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why he did 
not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did not want to reveal the 
smock beneath it. He flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like his older self. 

 The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the 
swing poles, as though it was the safe place in tag. 

 You are, said Snape to Lily. You are a witch. Ive been watching you for a 
while. But theres nothing wrong with that. My mums one, and Im a wizard. 

 Petunias laugh was like cold water. 

 Wizard! she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered from 
the shock of his unexpected appearance. I know who you are. Youre that Snape boy! 
They live down Spinners End by the river, she told Lily, and it was evident from her 
tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation. Why have you been spying 
on us? 

 Havent been spying, said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the 
bright sunlight. Wouldnt spy on you, anyway, he added spitefully, youre a Muggle. 

 Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake 
the tone. 

 Lily, come on, were leaving! she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, 
glaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the 
playground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him, recognized Snapes bitter 
disappointment, and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a while, 
and that it had all gone wrong 

 The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed around him. He was 
now in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. 
The shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing 
each other, cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock 
looked less pecular in the half light. 

 and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get 
letters. 

 But I have done magic outside school! 

 Were all right. We havent got wands yet. They let you off when youre a kid 
and you cant help it. But once youre eleven, he nodded importantly, and they start 
training you, then youve got to go careful. 

 There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air, 
and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, 
leaned in toward the boy, and said, It is real, isnt it? Its not a joke? Petunia says youre 
lying to me. Petunia says there isnt a Hogwarts. It is real, isnt it? 

 Its real for us, said Snape. Not for her. But well get the letter, you and me. 

 Really? whispered Lily. 

 Definitely, said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he 
struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in his 
destiny. 

 And will it really come by owl? Lily whispered. 

 Normally, said Snape. But youre Muggle-born, so someone from the school 
will have to come and explain to your parents. 

 Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born? 


 Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale 
face, the dark red hair. 

 No, he said. It doesnt make any difference. 

 Good, said Lily, relaxing. It was clear that she had been worrying. 

 Youve got loads of magic, said Snape. I saw that. All the time I was watching 
you 

 His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy 
ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily 
as he had watched her in the playground. 

 How are things at your house? Lily asked. 

 A little crease appeared between his eyes. 

 Fine, he said. 

 Theyre not arguing anymore? 

 Oh yes, theyre arguing, said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves and began 
tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. But it wont be that long 
and Ill be gone. 

 Doesnt your dad like magic? 

 He doesnt like anything, much, said Snape. 

 Severus? 

 A little smile twisted Snapes mouth when she said his name. 

 Yeah? 

 Tell me about the dementors again. 

 What dyou want to know about them for? 

 If I use magic outside school C  

 They wouldnt give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for people who 
do really bad stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. Youre not going to end up 
in Azkaban, youre too C  

 He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling noise behind 
Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing. 

 Tuney! said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to 
his feet. 

 Whos spying now? he shouted. What dyou want? 

 Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling 
for something hurtful to say. 

 What is that youre wearing, anyway? she said, pointing at Snapes chest. 
Your mums blouse? 

 There was a crack. A branch over Petunias head had fallen. Lily screamed. The 
branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears. 

 Tuney! 

 But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape. 

 Did you make that happen? 

 No. He looked both defiant and scared. 

 You did! She was backing away from him. You did! You hurt her! 

 No C no, I didnt! 

 But the lie did not convince Lily. After one last burning look, she ran from the 
little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused 


 And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around. He was on platform nine and 
three quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, 
sour-looking woman who greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a 
short distance away. The two girls stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to 
be pleading with her sister. Harry moved closer to listen. 

 Im sorry, Tuney, Im sorry! Listen C  She caught her sisters hand and held 
tight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away. Maybe once Im there C no, listen, 
Tuney! Maybe once Im there, Ill be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade 
him to change his mind! 

 I dont C want C to C go! said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her 
sisters grasp. You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a C a 

 Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their owners 
arms, over the owls, fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some 
already in their long black robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else 
greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart. 

  C you think I want to be a C a freak? 

 Lilys eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away. 

 Im not a freak, said Lily. Thats a horrible thing to say. 

 Thats where youre going, said Petunia with relish. A special school for 
freaks. You and that Snape boyweirdos, thats what you two are. Its good youre 
being separated from normal people. Its for our safety. 

 Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform with an 
air of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, 
and her voice was low and fierce. 

 You didnt think it was such a freaks school when you wrote to the headmaster 
and begged him to take you. 

 Petunia turned scarlet. 

 Beg? I didnt beg! 

 I saw his reply. It was very kind. 

 You shouldnt have read C  whispered Petunia, that was my private C how 
could you C ? 

 Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby. 
Petunia gasped. 

 That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room! 

 No C not sneaking C  Now Lily was on the defensive. Severus saw the 
envelope, and he couldnt believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, thats all! 
He says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of 
C  

 Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere! said Petunia, now as pale 
as she had been flushed. Freak! she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to where her 
parents stood 

 The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the 
Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his 
school robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle 
clothes. At last he stopped, outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were 


talking. Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against 
the windowpane. 

 Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She glanced at 
him and then looked back out of the window. She had been crying. 

 I dont want to talk to you, she said in a constricted voice. 

 Why not? 

 Tuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore. 

 So what? 

 She threw him a look of deep dislike. 

 So shes my sister! 

 Shes only a C  He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her 
eyes without being noticed, did not hear him. 

 But were going! he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. This 
is it! Were off to Hogwarts! 

 She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled. 

 Youd better be in Slytherin, said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a 
little. 

 Slytherin? 

 One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily 
or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been 
focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like 
Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that 
Snape so conspicuously lacked. 

 Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think Id leave, wouldnt you? James asked the 
boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. 
Sirius did not smile. 

 My whole family have been in Slytherin, he said. 

 Blimey, said James, and I thought you seemed all right! 

 Sirius grinned. 

 Maybe Ill break the tradition. Where are you heading, if youve got the choice? 

 James lifted an invisible sword. 

 Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart! Like my dad. 

 Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him. 

 Got a problem with that? 

 No, said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. If youd rather be 
brawny than brainy C  

 Wherere you hoping to go, seeing as youre neither? interjected Sirius. 

 James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to 
Sirius in dislike. 

 Come on, Severus, lets find another compartment. 

 Oooooo 

 James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed. 

 See ya, Snivellus! a voice called, as the compartment door slammed 

 And the scene dissolved once more 

 Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House tables, 
lined with rapt faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, Evans, Lily! 


 He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the 
rickety stool. Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a 
second after it had touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, Gryffindor! 

 Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat, handed it back to 
Professor McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she 
glanced back at Snape, and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius 
move up the bench to make room for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize 
him from the train, folded her arms, and firmly turned her back on him. 

 The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father join Lily 
and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen students remained to be 
sorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape. 

 Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his head. 
Slytherin! cried the Sorting Hat. 

 And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to 
where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge 
gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him 

 And the scene changed 

 Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry 
hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much 
taller they both were. A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting. 

 thought we were supposed to be friends? Snape was saying, Best friends? 

 We are, Sev, but I dont like some of the people youre hanging round with! Im 
sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, hes 
creepy! Dyou know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day? 

 Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow 
face. 

 That was nothing, said Snape. It was a laugh, thats all C  

 It was Dark Magic, and if you think thats funny C  

 What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to? demanded Snape. His color 
rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment. 

 Whats Potter got to do with anything? said Lily. 

 They sneak out at night. Theres something weird about that Lupin. Where does 
he keep going? 

 Hes ill, said Lily. They say hes ill C  

 Every month at the full moon? said Snape. 

 I know your theory, said Lily, and she sounded cold. Why are you so obsessed 
with them anyway? Why do you care what theyre doing at night? 

 Im just trying to show you theyre not as wonderful as everyone seems to think 
they are. 

 The intensity of his gaze made her blush. 

 They dont use Dark Magic, though. She dropped her voice. And youre being 
really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that 
tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatevers down 
there C  


 Snapes whole face contorted and he spluttered, Saved? Saved? You think he 
was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends too! Youre not going to C 
I wont let you C  

 Let me? Let me? 

 Lilys bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked at once. 

 I didnt m ean C I just dont want to see you made a fool of C He fancies you, 
James Potter fancies you! The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. And 
hes noteveryone thinksbig Quidditch hero C  Snapes bitterness and dislike were 
rendering him incoherent, and Lilys eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her 
forehead. 

 I know James Potters an arrogant toerag, she said, cutting across Snape. I 
dont need you to tell me that. But Mulcibers and Averys idea of humor is just evil. Evil, 
Sev. I dont understand how you can be friends with them. 

 Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mulciber and Avery. 
The moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they 
walked away there was a new spring in Snapes step 

 And the scene dissolved 

 Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. in 
Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed 
inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and 
Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what 
happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; he knew what had 
been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again He watched as Lily 
joined the group and went to Snapes defense. Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in 
his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: Mudblood. 

 The scene changed 

 Im sorry. 

 Im not interested. 

 Im sorry! 

 Save your breath 

 It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms 
folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower. 

 I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here. 

 I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just C  

 Slipped out? There was no pity in Lilys voice. Its too late. Ive made excuses 
for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and 
your precious little Death Eater friends C you see, you dont even deny it! You dont even 
deny thats what youre all aiming to be! You cant wait to join You-Know-Who, can 
you? 

 He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking. 

 I cant pretend anymore. Youve chosen your way, Ive chosen mine. 

 No C listen, I didnt mean C  

  C to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. 
Why should I be any different? 

 He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and 
climbed back through the portrait hole 


 The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform: Harry seemed 
to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he 
stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the 
branches of a few leafless trees. The adult Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his 
wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something or for someone His fear 
infected Harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over 
his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for C 

 Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air. Harry thought of 
lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand. 

 Dont kill me! 

 That was not my intention. 

 Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the 
wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his 
face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand. 

 Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me? 

 No C no message C Im here on my own account! 

 Snape was wringing his hands. He looked a little mad, with his straggling black 
hair flying around him. 

 I C I come with a warning C no, a request C please C  

 Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew through the 
night air around them, silence fell on the spot where he and Snape faced each other. 

 What request could a Death Eater make of me? 

 The C the prophecythe predictionTrelawney 

 Ah, yes, said Dumbledore. How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort? 

 Everything C everything I heard! said Snape. That is why C it is for that reason 
C he thinks it means Lily Evans! 

 The prophecy did not refer to a woman, said Dumbledore. It spoke of a boy 
born at the end of July C  

 You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down 
C kill them all C  

 If she means so much to you, said Dumbledore, surely Lord Voldemort will 
spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son? 

 I have C I have asked him C  

 You disgust me, said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much 
contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little, You do not care, then, about the 
deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want? 

 Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore. 

 Hide them all, then, he croaked. Keep her C them C safe. Please. 

 And what will you give me in return, Severus? 

 In C in return? Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, 
but after a long moment he said, Anything. 

 The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledores office, and something was 
making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was slumped forward in a chair 
and Dumbledore was standing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape 
raised his face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since 
leaving the wild hilltop. 


 I thoughtyou were goingto keep hersafe 

 She and James put their faith in the wrong person, said Dumbledore. Rather 
like you, Severus. Werent you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her? 

 Snapes breathing was shallow. 

 Her boy survives, said Dumbledore. 

 With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly. 

 Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and 
color of Lily Evanss eyes, I am sure? 

 DONT! bellowed Snape. Gonedead 

 Is this remorse, Severus? 

 I wishI wish I were dead 

 And what use would that be to anyone? said Dumbledore coldly. If you loved 
Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear. 

 Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledores words appeared 
to take a long time to reach him. 

 What C what do you mean? 

 You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect 
Lilys son. 

 He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone C  

 The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he 
does. 

 There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered 
his own breathing. At last he said, Very well. Very well. But never C never tell, 
Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot bearespecially Potters 
sonI want your word! 

 My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you? Dumbledore sighed, 
looking down into Snapes ferocious, anguished face. If you insist 

 The office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing up and down in 
front of Dumbledore. 

  C mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find 
himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent C  

 You see what you expect to see, Severus, said Dumbledore, without raising his 
eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today. Other teachers report that the boy is modest, 
likable, and reasonably talented. Personally, I find him an engaging child. 

 Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, Keep an eye on 
Quirrell, wont you? 

 A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dumbledore stood 
a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them 
on their way to bed. 

 Well? murmured Dumbledore. 

 Karkaroffs Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears retribution; 
you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell. Snape looked 
sideways at Dumbledores crooked-nosed profile. Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark 
burns. 

 Does he? said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came 
giggling in from the grounds. And are you tempted to join him? 


 No, said Snape, his black eyes on Fleurs and Rogers retreating figures. I am 
not such a coward. 

 No, agreed Dumbledore. You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. 
You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon 

 He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken 

 And now Harry stood in the headmasters office yet again. It was nighttime, and 
Dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk, apparently 
semiconscious. His right hand dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was 
muttering incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left 
hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down Dumbledores throat. After a 
moment or two, Dumbledores eyelids fluttered and opened. 

 Why, said Snape, without preamble, why did you put on that ring? It carries a 
curse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it? 

 Marvolo Gaunts ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the 
sword of Gryffindor lay beside it. 

 Dumbledore grimaced. 

 Iwas a fool. Sorely tempted 

 Tempted by what? 

 Dumbledore did not answer. 

 It is a miracle you managed to return here! Snape sounded furious. That ring 
carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope for; I have trapped 
the curse in one hand for the time being C  

 Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the 
expression of one being shown an interesting curio. 

 You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have? 

 Dumbledores tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather 
forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, I cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is no halting 
such a spell forever. It will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over 
time. 

 Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter 
of little or no concern to him. 

 I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus. 

 If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have been able to do more, 
buy you more time! said Snape furiously. He looked down at the broken ring and the 
sword. Did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse? 

 Something like thatI was delirious, no doubt said Dumbledore. With an 
effort he straightened himself in his chair. Well, really, this makes matters much more 
straightforward. 

 Snape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled. 

 I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to have the 
poor Malfoy boy murder me. 

 Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk from 
Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledores 
cursed hand, but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. 
Scowling, Snape said, The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely 


punishment for Luciuss recent failures. Slow torture for Dracos parents, while they 
watch him fail and pay the price. 

 In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I 
have, said Dumbledore. Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, 
once Draco fails, is yourself? 

 There was a short pause. 

 That, I think, is the Dark Lords plan. 

 Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a 
spy at Hogwarts? 

 He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes. 

 And if it does fall into his grasp, said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an 
aside, I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at 
Hogwarts? 

 Snape gave a stiff nod. 

 Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. A 
frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and 
guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you C  

  C much less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me, he thinks I have 
usurped Luciuss position. 

 All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of 
whatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing 
to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemorts wrath. 

 Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, Are you 
intending to let him kill you? 

 Certainly not. You must kill me. 

 There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the 
phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone. 

 Would you like me to do it now? asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony. Or 
would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph? 

 Oh, not quite yet, said Dumbledore, smiling. I daresay the moment will present 
itself in due course. Given what has happened tonight, he indicated his withered hand, 
we can be sure that it will happen within a year. 

 If you dont mind dying, said Snape roughly, why not let Draco do it? 

 That boys soul is not yet so damaged, said Dumbledore. I would not have it 
ripped apart on my account. 

 And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine? 

 You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain 
and humiliation, said Dumbledore. I ask this one great favor of you, Severus, because 
death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this years 
league. I confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it 
will be if, for instance, Greyback is involved C I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or 
dear Bellatrix, who likes to play with her food before she eats it. 

 His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently pierced 
Harry, as though the soul they discussed was visible to him. At last Snape gave another 
curt nod. 

 Dumbledore seemed satisfied. 


 Thank you, Severus 

 The office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling together 
in the deserted castle grounds by twilight. 

 What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted together? 
Snape asked abruptly. 

 Dumbledore looked weary. 

 Why? You arent trying to give him more detentions, Severus? The boy will 
soon have spent more time in detention than out. 

 He is his father over again C  

 In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mothers. I spend 
time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him 
before it is too late. 

 Information, repeated Snape. You trust himyou do not trust me. 

 It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is essential 
that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do. 

 And why may I not have the same information? 

 I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a basket that 
spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort. 

 Which I do on your orders! 

 And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underestimate the constant 
danger in which you place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort what appears to be 
valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody 
but you. 

 Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency, whose 
magic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lords mind! 

 Voldemort fears that connection, said Dumbledore. Not so long ago he had 
one small taste of what truly sharing Harrys mind means to him. It was pain such as he 
has never experienced. He will not try to possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that 
way. 

 I dont understand. 

 Lord Voldemorts soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul 
like Harrys. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame C  

 Souls? We were talking of minds! 

 In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of the 
other. 

 Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They were close 
by the Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone near them. 

 After you have killed me, Severus C  

 You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of me! 
snarled Snape, and real anger flared in the thin face now. You take a great deal for 
granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have changed my mind! 

 You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about services you 
owe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend? 

 Snape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed. 

 Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not complain that I 
have no confidence in you 


 They were back in Dumbledores office, the windows dark, and Fawkes sat silent 
as Snape sat quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him, talking. 

 Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, 
otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done? 

 But what must he do? 

 That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus. There will come a 
time C after my death C do not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time when Lord 
Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake. 

 For Nagini? Snape looked astonished. 

 Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake 
forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I 
think, it will be safe to tell Harry. 

 Tell him what? 

 Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes. 

 Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her 
own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, 
and a fragment of Voldemorts soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself 
onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives 
inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a 
connection with Lord Voldemorts mind that he has never understood. And while that 
fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, 
Lord Voldemort cannot die. 

 Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel, they 
were so far away from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears. 

 So the boythe boy must die? asked Snape quite calmly. 

 And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential. 

 Another long silence. Then Snape said, I thoughtall those yearsthat we were 
protecting him for her. For Lily. 

 We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, 
to let him try his strength, said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. Meanwhile, the 
connection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth. Sometimes I have 
thought he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when 
he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort. 

 Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified. 

 You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment? 

 Dont be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die? 

 Lately, only those whom I could not save, said Snape. He stood up. You have 
used me. 

 Meaning? 

 I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. 
Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potters son safe. Now you tell me you have 
been raising him like a pig for slaughter C  

 But this is touching, Severus, said Dumbledore seriously. Have you grown to 
care for the boy, after all? 

 For him? shouted Snape. Expecto Patronum! 


 From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe. She landed on the office floor, 
bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her 
fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of 
tears. 

 After all this time? 

 Always, said Snape. 

 And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of 
Dumbledore behind his desk. 

 You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harrys departure from his 
aunt and uncles, said Dumbledore. Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort 
believes you so well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, 
ought to ensure Harrys safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if 
you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincinglyI am 
counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemorts good books as long as possible, or 
Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows 

 Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern, 
Mundunguss face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration. 

 You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix, Snape murmured, that they use 
decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. Its the only thing that might work. You will 
forget that I have suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand? 

 I understand, murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused 

 Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark 
night: He was accompanied by other hodded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a 
Harry who was really George A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his 
wand, pointing it directly at Lupins back. 

 Sectumsempra! shouted Snape. 

 But the spell, intended for the Death Eaters wand hand, missed and hit George 
instead C 

 And next, Snape was kneeling in Siriuss old bedroom. Tears were dripping from 
the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The second page carried 
only a few words: 

 

could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her minds going, 
personally! 

 

 Lots of love, 

 Lily 

 

 Snape took the page bearing Lilys signature, and her love, and tucked it inside 
his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the 
part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto 
the floor, under the chest of drawers 

 And now Snape stood again in the headmasters study as Phineas Nigellus came 
hurrying into his portrait. 

 Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood C  

 Do not use that word! 


  C the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard 
her! 

 Good. Very good! cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmasters 
chair. Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of 
need and valor C and he must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read 
Harrys mind and see you acting for him C  

 I know, said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dumbledore and 
pulled at its side. It swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he 
took the sword of Gryffindor. 

 And you still arent going to tell me why its so important to give Potter the 
sword? said Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes. 

 No, I dont think so, said Dumbledores portrait. He will know what to do with 
it. And Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to your appearance after 
George Weasleys mishap C  

 Snape turned at the door. 

 Dont worry, Dumbledore, he said coolly. I have a plan 

 And Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later he 
lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same rooms Snape might just have closed the door. 

 

Chapter Thirty-Four 

The Forest Again 

 

Finally, the truth. Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office 
where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory, Harry understood at 
last that he was not supposed to survive. His job was to walk calmly into Deaths 
welcoming arms. Along the way, he was to dispose of Voldemorts remaining links to 
life, so that when at last he flung himself across Voldemorts path, and did not raise a 
wand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done 
in Godrics Hollow would be finished. Neither would live, neither could survive. 

 He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in his dread of 
death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, 
and soon. Its beats were numbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and 
walked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest? 

 Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum pounding 
inside him. Would it hurt to die? All those times he had thought that it was about to 
happen and escaped, he had never really thought of the thing itself: His will to live had 
always been so much stronger than his fear of death. Yet it did not occur to him now to 
try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It was over, he knew it, and all that was left was the 
thing itself: dying. 

 If he could only have died on that summers night when he had left number four, 
Privet Drive, for the last time, when the noble phoenix feather wand had saved him! If he 
could only have died like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened! 
Or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved . . . He 
envied even his parents deaths now. This cold-blooded walk to his own destruction 


would require a different kind of bravery. He felt his fingers trembling slightly and made 
an effort to control them, although no one could see him; the portraits on the walls were 
all empty. 

 Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware 
of his own living body than ever before. Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he 
was, brain and nerve and bounding heart? It would all be gone . . . or at least, he would be 
gone from it. His breath came slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely 
dry, but so were his eyes. 

 Dumbledores betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a bigger 
plan: Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he realized that now. He had never 
questioned his own assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his 
life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. 
Dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to him, and obediently he had 
continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How 
neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the boy 
who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not be a calamity, 
but another blow against Voldemort. 

 And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he would keep 
going to the end, even though it was his end, because he had taken trouble to get to know 
him, hadnt he? Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone 
else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of 
Fred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead in the Great Hall forced their way back into his minds 
eye, and for a moment he could hardly breathe. Death was impatient . . . 

 But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: The snake survived. One 
Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, 
that would mean an easier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it . . . Ron and 
Hermione would know what needed to be done, of course . . . That would have been why 
Dumbledore wanted him to confide in two others . . . so that if he fulfilled his true destiny 
a little early, they could carry on . . . 

 Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of 
the incontrovertible truth, which was that he must die. I must die. It must end. 

 Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country; he felt as 
though he had parted from them long ago. There would be no good-byes and no 
explanations, he was determined of that. This was a journey they could not take together, 
and the attempts they would make to stop him would waste valuable time. He looked 
down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth birthday. Nearly half 
of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed. 

 He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird. Perhaps it 
knew it had little time left, perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetimes beats before 
the end. He did not look back as he closed the office door. 

 The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he had 
already died. The portrait people were still missing from their frames; the whole place 
was eerily still, as if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where 
the dead and the mourners were crammed. 

 Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through the floors, 
at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall. Perhaps some tiny part of 


him hoped to be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, 
impenetrable, perfect, and he reached the front doors easily. 

 Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair that was carrying 
a body in from the grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his 
stomach: Colon Creevey, though underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, 
Crabbe, and Goyle had done. He was tiny in death. 

 You know what? I can manage him alone, Neville, said Oliver Wood, and he 
heaved Colin over his shoulder in a firemans lift and carried him into the Great Hall. 

 Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with 
the back of his hand. He looked like an old man. Then he set off on the steps again into 
the darkness to recover more bodies. 

 Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People were moving 
around, trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the dead, but he could not 
see any of the people he loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other 
Weasleys, no Luna. He felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just 
one last look at them; but then, would he ever have the strength to stop looking? It was 
better like this. 

 He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly four in the 
morning, and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their 
breath, waiting to see whether he could do what he must. 

 Harry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another body. 

 Neville. 

 Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure! 

 Harry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to him out of nowhere, born 
out of a desire to make absolutely sure. 

 Where are you going, alone? Neville asked suspiciously. 

 Its all part of the plan, said Harry. Theres someting Ive got to do. Listen --- 
Neville --- 

 Harry! Neville looked suddenly scared. Harry, youre not thinking of handing 
yourself over? 

 No, Harry lied easily. Course not . . . this is something else. But I might be 
out of sight for a while. You know Voldemorts snake. Neville? Hes got a huge snake . . . 
Calls it Nagini . . . 

 Ive heard, yeah . . . What about it? 

 Its got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case they --- 

 The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, made it impossible 
to keep talking. But he pulled himself together again: This was crucial, he must be like 
Dumbledore, keep a cool head, make sure there were backups, others to carry on. 
Dumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now 
Neville would take Harrys place: There would still be three in the secret. 

 Just in case theyre --- busy --- and you get the chance --- 

 Kill the snake? 

 Kill the snake, Harry repeated. 

 All right, Harry. Youre okay, are you? 

 Im fine. Thanks, Neville. 

 But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on. 


 Were all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that? 

 Yeah, I --- 

 The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he could not go on. 
Neville did not seem to find it strange. He patted Harry on the shoulder, released him, 
and walked away to look for more bodies. 

 Harry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Someone else was 
moving not far away, stooping over another prone figure on the ground. He was feet 
away from her when he realized it was Ginny. 

 He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was whispering for 
her mother. 

 Its all right, Ginny was saying. Its ok. Were going to get you inside. 

 But I want to go home, whispered the girl. I dont want to fight anymore! 

 I know, said Ginny, and her voice broke. Its going to be all right. 

 Ripples of cold undulated over Harrys skin. He wanted to shout out to the night, 
he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to know where he was going. 
He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to be sent back home. . . . 

 But he was home. Hogwards was the first and best home he had known. He and 
Voldemort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here. . . . 

 Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her hand. With a huge 
effort Harry forced himself on. He thought he saw Ginny look around as he passed, and 
wondered whether she had sensed someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he 
did not look back. 

 Hagrids hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no sound of Fang 
scrabbling at the door, his bark booming in welcome. All those visits to Hagrid, and the 
gleam of the copper kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great 
bearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert . . . 

 He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and he stopped. 

 A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their chill, 
and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it. He had not strength left 
for a Patronus. He could no longer control his own trembling. It was not, after all, so easy 
to die. Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so 
precious: To think that people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it 
dragged, and he was clinging to each second. At the same time he thought that he would 
not be able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was ended, the Snitch had 
been caught, it was time to leave the air. . . . 

 The Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his 
neck and he pulled it out. 

 I open at the close. 

 Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted time to move as 
slowly as possible, he seemed to have sped up, and understanding was coming so fast it 
seemed to have bypassed though. This was the close. This was the moment. 

 He pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, I am about to die. 

 The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised Dracos wand 
beneath the Cloak, and murmured, Lumos. 

 The black stone with is jagged crack running down the center sat in the two 
halves of the Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line 


representing the Elder Wand. The triangle and circle representing the Cloak and the stone 
were still discernible. 

 And again Harry understood without having to think. It did not matter about 
bringing them back, for he was about to join them. He was not really fetching them: They 
were fetching him. 

 He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times. 

 He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around him that 
suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twig-strewn ground that 
marked the outer edge of the forest. He opened his eyes and looked around. 

 They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They resembled most 
closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been memory 
made nearly solid. Less substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they 
moved toward him. And on each face, there was the same loving smile. 

 James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes in which 
he had died, and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, 
like Mr. Weasleys. 

 Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen him in life. 
He loped with an easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face. 

 Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker and darker. 
He looked happy to be back in this familiar place, scene of so many adolescent 
wanderings. 

 Lilys smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew closer to 
him, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as though she would 
never be able to look at him enough. 

 Youve been so brave. 

 He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he would like to 
stand and look at her forever, and that would be enough. 

 You are nearly there, said James. Very close. We are . . . so proud of you. 

 Does it hurt? 

 The childish question had fallen from Harrys lips before he could stop it. 

 Dying? Not at all, said Sirius. Quicker and easier than falling asleep. 

 And he will want it to be quick. He wants it over, said Lupin. 

 I didnt want you to die, Harry said. These words came without his volition. 
Any of you. Im sorry --- 

 He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him. 

 --- right after youd had your son . . . Remus, Im sorry --- 

 I am sorry too, said Lupin. Sorry I will never know him . . . but he will know 
why I died and I hope he will understand. I was trying to make a world in which he could 
live a happier life. 

 A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair 
at Harrys brow. He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it would have to be his 
decision. 

 Youll stay with me? 

 Until the very end, said James. 

 They wont be able to see you? asked Harry. 

 We are part of you, said Sirius. Invisible to anyone else. 


 Harry looked at his mother. 

 Stay close to me, he said quietly. 

 And he set of. The dementors chill did not overcome him; he passed through it 
with his companions, and they acted like Patronuses to him, and together they marched 
through the old trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots 
gnarled and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the 
darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly 
Voldemort was, but sure that he would find him. Beside him, making scarcely a sound, 
walked James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his courage, and the reason 
he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other. 

 His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working without 
conscious instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the body he was about to 
leave. The dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him 
now than the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the 
ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward 
Voldemort . . . 

 A thud and a whisper: Some other living creature had stirred close by. Harry 
stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother and father, Lupin and 
Sirius stopped too. 

 Someone there, came a rough whisper close at hand. Hes got an Invisibility 
Cloak. Could it be --- ? 

 Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree: Their wands flared, and Harry 
saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, his 
mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything. 

 Definitely heard something, said Yaxley. Animal, dyou reckon? 

 That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here, said Dolohov, 
glancing over his shoulder. 

 Yaxley looked down at his watch. 

 Times nearly up. Porters had his hour. Hes not coming. 

 Better go back, said Yaxley. Find out what the plan is now. 

 He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry followed them, 
knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He glanced sideways, 
and his mother smiled at him, and his father nodded encouragement. 

 They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and Yaxley and 
Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the 
monstrous Aragog had once lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the 
swarms of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight 
for their cause. 

 A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell over a 
crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still masked and 
hooded; others showed their faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting 
massive shadows over the scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harry saw 
Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; the great blond Rowle was dabbing at his 
bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, 
whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension. 


 Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and his 
white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have been praying, or 
else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, 
though absurdly of a child counting in a game of hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still 
swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a 
monstrous halo. 

 When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up. 

 No sign of him, my Lord, said Dolohov. 

 Voldemorts expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the 
firelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers. 

 My Lord --- 

 Bellatrix had spoken: She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a little 
bloody but otherwise unharmed. 

 Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another word, but 
eyed him in worshipful fascination. 

 I thought he would come, said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his eyes on 
the leaping flames. I expected him to come. 

 Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now throwing 
itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside. 
His hands were sweating as he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his 
robes, with his wand. He did not want to be tempted to fight. 

 I was, it seems . . . mistaken, said Voldemort. 

 You werent. 

 Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster: He did not 
want to sound afraid. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his numb fingers, and 
out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped 
forward into the firelight. At that moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It 
was just the two of them. 

 The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the Death 
Eaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. Voldemort had 
frozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved 
toward him, with nothing but the fire between them. 

 Then a voice yelled: HARRY! NO! 

 He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His massive body 
shook the branches overhead as he struggled, desperate. 

 NO! NO! HARRY, WHATRE YEH --- ? 

 QUIET! shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand, Hagrid was silenced. 

 Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Voldemort to Harry, 
her breast heaving. The only things that moved were the flames and the snake, coiling 
and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind Voldemorts head. 

 Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made no attempt to draw it. He 
knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if he managed to point the wand at 
Nagini, fifty curses would hit him first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each 
other, and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing 
before him, and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth. 


 Harry Potter, he said very softly. His voice might have been part of the spitting 
fire. The Boy Who Lived. 

 None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: Everything was waiting. 
Hagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of 
Ginny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips on his --- 

 Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a curious 
child, wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into the red 
eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost 
control, before he betrayed fear --- 

 He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone. 

 

Chapter Thirty-Five 

Kings Cross 

He lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone. Nobody was 
watching. Nobody else was there. He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself. 

 A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must 
be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some 
surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too. 

 Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that 
he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it 
did intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. 
In opening them, he discovered that he had eyes. 

 He lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. 
His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet 
formed into surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm 
nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be. 

 He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing 
glasses anymore. 

 Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him: 
the small soft thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful 
noise, yet also slightly indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was 
eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful. 

 For the first time, he wished he were clothed. 

 Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away. 
He took them and pulled them on. They were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary 
how they had appeared just like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . . 

 He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? The 
longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high 
above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those 
odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. . . . 

 Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent 
themselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than 
the Great Hall, with that clear domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only 
person there, except for C 


 He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form 
of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and 
it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, 
struggling for breath. 

 He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want 
to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. 
Soon he stood near enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like 
a coward. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him. 

 You cannot help. 

 He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly and 
upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. 

 Harry. He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and 
undamaged. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk. 

 Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child 
lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some 
distance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, 
and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmasters face. Dumbledores long 
silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked 
nose: Everything was as he had remembered it. And yet . . . 

 But youre dead, said Harry. 

 Oh yes, said Dumbledore matter-of-factly. 

 Then . . . Im dead too? 

 Ah, said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. That is the question, isnt it? 
On the whole, dear boy, I think not. 

 They looked at each other, the old man still beaming. 

 Not? repeated Harry. 

 Not, said Dumbledore. 

 But . . . Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not 
seem to be there. But I should have died C I didnt defend myself! I meant to let him kill 
me! 

 And that, said Dumbledore, will, I think, have made all the difference. 

 Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light; like fire: Harry had 
never seen the man so utterly, so palpably content. 

 Explain, said Harry. 

 But you already know, said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together. 

 I let him kill me, said Harry. Didnt I? 

 You did, said Dumbledore, nodding. Go on! 

 So the part of his soul that was in me . . . 

 Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad 
smile of encouragement on his face. 

 . . . has it gone? 

 Oh yes! said Dumbledore. Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and 
completely your own, Harry. 

 But then . . . 

 Harry trembled over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trembled 
under the chair. 


 What is that, Professor? 

 something that is beyond either of our help, said Dumbledore. 

 But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse, Harry started again, and nobody died 
for me this time C how can I be alive? 

 I think you know, said Dumbledore. Think back. Remember what he did, in 
his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty. 

 Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a 
palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of 
railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creatures under the 
chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort. 

 He took my blood, said Harry. 

 Precisely! said Dumbledore. He took your blood and rebuilt his living body 
with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lilys protection inside both of you! He thethered 
you to life while he lives! 

 I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way around! 
I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing? 

 He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature 
behind them and glanced back at it yet again. 

 Are you sure we cant do anything? 

 There is no help possible. 

 Then explain . . . more, said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled. 

 You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He 
had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of 
unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what 
escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. 
He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived. 

 And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which 
Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and 
childrens tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands 
nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach 
of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped. 

 He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a 
tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body 
keeps her sacrafice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does 
Voldemorts one last hope for himself. 

 Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him. 

 And you knew this? You knew C all along? 

 I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good, said Dumbledore happily, 
and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them 
continued to whimper and tremble. 

 Theres more, said Harry. Theres more to it. Why did my wand break the 
wand he borrowed? 

 As to that, I cannot be sure. 

 Have a guess, then, said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed. 

 What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have 
journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what 


I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have 
predicted or explained it to Voldemort. 

 Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond 
between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to 
yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mothers sacrafice into 
himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, 
he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able 
to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all. 

 Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies 
together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort 
proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something 
very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, 
who never knew that your wand was a twin of his, had ever expected. 

 He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even 
embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. 
Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened 
between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters. 

 I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of 
Voldemorts wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort 
himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was 
both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic 
much more powerful than anything Luciuss wand had ever performed. Your wand now 
contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemorts own deadly skill: 
What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoys stand? 

 But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it? 
asked Harry. 

 My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had 
tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that 
wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good 
one, I am sure, Dumbledore finished kindly. 

 Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be 
sure of things like time, here. 

 He killed me with your wand. 

 He failed to kill you with my wand, Dumbledore corrected Harry. I think we 
can agree that you are not dead C though, of course, he added, as if fearing he had been 
discourteous, I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe. 

 I feel great at the moment, though, said Harry, looking down at his clean, 
unblemished hands. Where are we, exactly? 

 Well, I was going to ask you that, said Dumbledore, looking around. Where 
would you say that we are? 

 Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that 
he had an answer ready to give. 

 It looks, he said slowly, like Kings Cross station. Except a lo cleaner and 
empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see. 

 Kings Cross station! Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. Good 
gracious, really? 


 Well, where do you think we are? asked Harry, a little defensively. 

 My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party. 

 Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared 
at him, then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current 
location. 

 The Deathly Hallows, he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the 
smile from Dumbledores face. 

 Ah, yes, he said. He even looked a little worried. 

 Well? 

 For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old 
man, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. 

 Can you forgive me? he said. Can you forgive me for not trusting you? For not 
telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that 
you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time 
now, that you are the better man. 

 What are you talking about? asked Harry, startled by Dumbledores tone, by the 
sudden tears in his eyes. 

 The Hallows, the Hallows, murmured Dumbledore. A desperate mans 
dream! 

 But theyre real! 

 Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools, said Dumbledore. And I was such a 
fool. But you know, dont you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know. 

 What do I know? 

 Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the 
brilliantly blue eyes. 

 Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than 
Voldemort? 

 Of course you were, said Harry. Of course C how can you ask that? You never 
killed if you could avoid it! 

 True, true, said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. Yet 
I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry. 

 Not the way he did, said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it 
was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. 
Hallows, not Horcruxes. 

 Hallows, murmured Dumbledore, not Horcruxes. Precisely. 

 There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer 
looked around. 

 Grindelwald was looking for them too? he asked. 

 Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. 

 It was the thing, above all, that drew us together, he said quietly. Two clever, 
arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godrics Hollow, as I am 
sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore 
the place the third brother had died. 

 So its true? asked Harry. All of it? The Peverell brothers C 

 were the three brothers of the tale, said Dumbledore, nodding. Oh yes, I 
think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the 


Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those 
powerful objects. The story of them being Deaths own Hallows seems to me the sort of 
legend that might have sprung up around such creations. 

 The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, 
mother to daughter, right down to Ignotuss last living descendant, who was born, as 
Ignotus was, in the village of Godrics Hollow. 

 Dumbledore smiled at Harry. 

 Me? 

 You. You have guessed,, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the 
night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It 
explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I 
was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of 
uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look. . . . It was 
a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . 
and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself! 

 His tone was unbearably bitter. 

 The Cloak wouldnt have helped them survive, though, Harry said quickly. 
Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldnt have made them 
curse-proof. 

 true, sighed Dumbledore. True. 

 Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him. 

 So youd given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak? 

 Oh yes, said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet 
Harrys eyes. You know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I 
despise myself. 

 But I dont despise you C 

 Then you should, said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. You know the 
secret of my sisters ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how 
my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died In Azkaban. You know how my 
mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana. 

 I resented it, Harry. 

 Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harrys 
head, into the distance. 

 I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. 

 Do not misunderstand me, he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked 
ancient again. I loved them, I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I 
was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could 
possibly imagine. 

 So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged 
sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped 
and wasted, I thought! And then of course, he came. . . . 

 Dumbledore looked directly into Harrys eyes again. 

 Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. 
Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the 
glorious young leaders of the revolution. 


 Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would 
all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits 
for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I 
did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams 
would come true. 

 And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, 
how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to 
power! The Resurrection Stone C to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an 
army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all 
responsibility from my shoulders. 

 And the Cloak . . . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both 
of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of 
course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought 
that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak 
was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who had united all 
three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean invincible. 

 Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of 
insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. 

 And then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, 
unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he 
shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth and seek Hallows with a 
fragile and unstable sister in tow. 

 The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always 
sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . 
after all my mothers care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor. 

 Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and 
was glad to find that he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore 
gradually regained control. 

 Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with 
his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the 
Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I 
was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price 
of my shame. 

 Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand 
of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, 
but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with 
power. 

 But youd have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scimgeour! burst out 
Harry. 

 Would I? asked Dumbledore heavily. I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very 
young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, 
but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those 
who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they 
must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well. 

 I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher C 

 You were the best --- 


 --- you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of 
young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he 
did, but less, I think, than I feared him. 

 Oh, not death, said Dumbledore, in answer to Harrys questioning look. Not 
what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I 
was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in 
that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me 
cowardly: You would be right, Harry. I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it 
had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, 
but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life. 

 I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him 
until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and 
he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could. 

 Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand. 

 Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who 
struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to 
have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in 
the mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it 
had exercised over Harry. 

 They sat in silence for a long time, and the whipmerings of the creature behind 
them barely disturbed Harry anymore. 

 At last he said, Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He 
lied, you know, pretended he had never had it. 

 Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked 
nose. 

 They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I 
hope that is true. I would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he 
had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent 
Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . . 

 . . .or maybe from breaking into your tomb? suggested Harry, and Dumbledore 
dabbed his eyes. 

 After another short pause Harry said, You tried to use the Resurrection Stone. 

 Dumbledore nodded. 

 When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the 
Gaunts --- the Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for 
very different reasons --- I lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that I was not a Horcrux, 
that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I 
imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them 
how very, very sorry, I was. . . . 

 I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was 
unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final 
proof. 

 Why? said Harry. It was natural! You wanted to see them again. Whats wrong 
with that? 

 Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to 
possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, 


and not boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and use it, because I 
took it, not for gain, but to save others from it. 

 But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiousity, and so it could never have worked 
for me as it works for you, its true owners. The stone I would have used in an attempt to 
drag back those who are at peace, rather than enable my self-sacrafice, as you did. You 
are the worthy possessor of the Hallows. 

 Dumbledore patted Harrys hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; 
he could not help himself. How coul dhe remain angry with Dumbledore now? 

 Why did you have to make it so difficult? 

 Dumbledores smile was tremulous. 

 I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that 
your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright 
with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the 
wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess 
them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to 
run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far 
worse things in the living world than dying. 

 And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows? 

 I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned 
into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry. I doubt that he woul dhave 
been interested in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and 
as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He 
does not love. 

 But you expected him to go after the wand? 

 I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemorts in the 
graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by 
superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence 
of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no 
better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you 
that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set 
out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand 
has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand 
removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus . . . 

 If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder 
Wand, didnt you? 

 I admit that was my intention, said Dumbledore, but it did not work as I 
intended, did it? 

 No, said Harry. That bit didnt work out. 

 The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sate 
without talking for the longest time yet. The realization of what would happen next 
settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow. 

 Ive got to go back, havent I? 

 That is up to you. 

 Ive got a choice? 

 Oh yes, Dumbledore smiled at him. We are in Kings Cross you say? I think 
that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . lets say . . . board a train. 


 And where would it take me? 

 On, said Dumbledore simply. 

 Silence again. 

 Voldemorts got the Elder Wand. 

 True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand. 

 But you want me to go back? 

 I think, said Dumbledore, that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he 
may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less 
to fear from returning here than he does. 

 Harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the 
shadow beneath the distant chair. 

 Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live 
without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families 
are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, they we saw good-bye for the present. 

 Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as 
walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he 
knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and 
Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each others faces. 

 Tell me one last thing, said Harry, Is this real? Or has this been happening 
inside my head? 

 Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harrys 
ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure. 

 Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that 
mean it is not real? 

 

 

 

Chapter Thirty-Six 

The Flaw in the Plan 

 

 

He was flying facedown on the grond again. The smell of the forest filled his nostrils. He 
could feel 

the cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses which have been 
knocked sideways 

by the fall cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place where Killing 
Curse had hit him 

felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, but he remained exactly where 
he had fallen, with 

his left arm bent out at an akward angle and his mouth gaping. 

 He had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead 
hurried footsteps, 

whispers, and solicitous murmurs filled the air. 

 "My Lord... my Lord..." 


 It was Bellatrix's voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his 
eyes, but allowed 

his other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed 
beneath his robes because 

he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in 
the area of his stomach 

told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight. 

 "My Lord..." 

 "That will do," said Voldemort's voice. 

 More footsteps. Several people were backing away from the same spot. Desperate 
to see what was 

happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a milimeter. 

 Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hurrying 
away from him, 

returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling 
beside Voldemort. 

 Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters 
have been buddled 

around Voldemort, who seem to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened 
when he had hit Harry with 

the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had 
briefly fallen unconcious 

and both of them had now returned. . . 

 "My Lord, let me --" 

 "I do not require assitance," said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, 
Harry pictured 

Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. "The boy . . . Is he dead?" 

 There was a complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he 
felt their concentraded 

gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or an 
eyelid might twitch. 

 "You," said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shrick of pain. 
"Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead." 

 Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his 
heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be 

examined, but at the same time nothing, small comfort through it was, that Voldemort 
was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort 

suspected that all had not gone to plan . . . . 

 Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry's face, and felt his heart. 
He could hear the woman's fast breathing, 

her pounding of life against his ribs. 

 "Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?" 

 The whisper was barely audible, her lips were an inch from his car, her head bent 
so low that her long hair shielded his face 

from the onlookers. 

 "Yes," he breathed back. 


 He felt the hand on his chest contract: her nails pierced him. Then it was 
withdrawn. She had sat up. 

 "He is dead!" Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers. 

 And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and 
through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red 

and silver light shoot into the air in celebration. 

 Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only 
way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, 

and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether 
Voldemort won. 

 "You see?" screeched Voldemort over the tumult. "Harry Potter is dead by my 
hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! 

Watch! Crucio!" 

 Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain 
unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected 

 to humiliation to prove Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his 
determination to remain limp, yet the pain he 

expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air. His glasses 
flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath 

his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell no ground for the last 
time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks 

of laughter. 

 "Now," said Voldemort, "we go to the castle, and show them what has become of 
their hero. Who shall drag the body? No - Wait - " 

 There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry felt the 
ground trembling beneath him. 

 "You carry him," Voldemort said. "He will be nice and visible in your arms, will 
he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the 

glasses - put on the glasses - he must be recognizable - " 

 Someone slammed Harry's glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but 
the enormous hands that lifted him into the air 

were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid's arms trembling with the force of his 
heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him 

as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to 
intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost. 

 "Move," said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through 
the close-growing trees, back through the forest. 

Branches caught at Harry's hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, 
his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the 

Death Eaters croed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to 
see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of 

Harry Potter. . . . 

 The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees 
creaking and falling as they passed; they made so 

much din that birds toes shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters 
were drowned. The victorious procession marched 


on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the 
darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees 

were beginning to thin. 

 "BANE!" 

 Hagrid's unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry's eyes open. "Happy now, are 
yeh, that yeh didn't fight, yeh cowardly bunch o' nags? 

Are yeh happy Harry Potter's - d-dead . . . ?" 

 Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how 
many centaurs were watching their procession pass; 

he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs 
as they left them behind. A little later, Harry 

sensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest. 

 "Stop." 

 Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort's command, 
because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled 

over them where they sood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that 
patrolled the other trees. They would not affect him now. 

The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his 
father's stag kept guardian in his heart. 

 Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself 
because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically 

magnified so that it swelled through the ground, crashing upon Harry's eardrums. 

 "Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while 
you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his 

body as proof that your hero is gone. 

 "The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters 
outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must 

be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman or child, will be 
slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the 

castle now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your 
brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will 

join me in the new world we shall build togheter." 

 There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to 
him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again. 

 "Come," said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was 
forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw 

Voldemort striding in front them, wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders, 
now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility 

of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death 
Eaters, who marched on the either side of them through the 

slowly lightening darkness . . . . 

 "Harry," sobbed Hagrid. "Oh, Harry . . . Harry . . ." 

 Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle 
and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices 

of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within. 

 "Stop." 


 The Death Eaters camte to a halt; Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing 
the opne front doors of the school. He could see, even 

though his closed lids, the teddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the 
entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom 

he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid's arms. 

 "NO!" 

 The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that 
Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard 

another women laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall's despair. 
He squinted again for a single second and saw the open 

 doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps 
to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry's death for 

themselves. He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini's head 
with a single white finger. He closed his eyes again. 

 "No!" 

 "No!" 

 "Harry! HARRY!" 

 Ron's, Hermione's, and Ginny's voices were worse than McGonagall's; Harry 
wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie 

silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took up the cause, 
screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eathers, until - 

 "SILENCE!" cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, 
and silence was forced upn them all. "It is over! Set him down, 

Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!" 

 Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass. 

 "You see? said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward 
right beside the place where he lay. "Harry Potter is dead! Do you 

understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to 
sacrifice themselves for him!" 

 "He beat you!" yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts 
were shouting and screaming again until a second, more 

powerful bang extinguished their voices once more. 

 "He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds," said Voldemort, 
and there was a relish in his voice for the lie. "killed while trying 

to save himself - " 

 But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a 
flash of light, and grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal 

amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort: Harry saw the 
figure hit the ground. Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger's 

wand aside and laughing. 

 "And who is this?" he said in his soft snake's hiss. "Who has volunteered to 
demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the 

battle is lost?" 

 Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh. 

 "It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so 
much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?" 


 "Ah, yes, I remember," said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was 
struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unproctected, standing in the 

no-man's-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. "But you are a pureblood, 
aren't you, my brave boy? Voldemort asked Neville, who stood facing him, 

his empty hands curled in fists. 

 "So what if I am?" said Neville loudly. 

 "You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very 
valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom." 

 "I'll join you when hell freezes over," said Neville. "Dumbledore's Army!" he 
shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom 

Voldemort's Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold. 

 "Very well," said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his 
voice than in the most powerful curse. "If that is your choice, Longbottom, 

we revert to the original plan. On your head," he said quietly, "be it." 

 Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds 
later, out of one of the castle's shattered windows, something that looked like a 
misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemort's hand. He shook the 
mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, emtpy and ragged: the Sorting Hat. 

 "There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School," said Voldemort. "There will 
be no more Houses. The emblem, sheild and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar 
Slythering, will suffice everyone. Won't they, Neville Longbottom?" 

 He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the hat onto 
Neville's head, so thta it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the 
watching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, 
holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay. 

 "Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish 
enough to continue to oppose me," said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he 
caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames. 

 Screams split the dawn, and Neville was a flame, rooted to the spot, unable to 
move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act - 

 And then many things happened at the same moment. 

 They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like 
hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the 
castle, uttering lowd war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side 
of the castel and yelled, "HAGGER!" His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort's 
giants: They ran at Grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake. Then came hooves 
and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who 
broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibilty Cloak from inside his 
robes, swunt it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too. 

 In one swift, fluid motin, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; 
the flaming har fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a 
glittering, rubied handle - 

 The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming 
crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of te stampending centaurs, and yet, it 
seemd to draw every eye. With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake's head, 
which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and 


Voldemort's mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake's 
body thudded to the ground at his feet- 

 Hidden beneath the Invisibilty Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville 
and Voldemort before the latter could raise his stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid's yell 
came loudets of all. 

 "HARRY!" Hagrid shouted. "HARRY - WHERE'S HARRY?" 

 Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone 
was feeling the giants' stamping feet, and nearer and nearar thundered the reinforcements 
that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winget creatues soaring the heads 
of Voldemort's giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes 
while Grawp punched and pummeled them and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts 
and Death Eaters alike were being forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes 
and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who 
had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd. Still hidden beneath 
the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffered into the entrance hall: He was searching for 
Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into 
the Great Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left 
and right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort's would-be victims. Seamus 
Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, datted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the 
fight already flourishing inside it. 

 And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and 
Harry saw Charlie Weasly overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emeral 
pijamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and 
friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeeps 
and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the 
hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was 
blasted off its hinges. 

 The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed intot he entrance hall, screaming and 
waving carving knives and cleaver, and at their head, the locker of Regulus Black 
bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog's voice audible even above this din: 
"Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the 
name of brave Regulus! Fight!" 

 They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shim of Death Eaters their tiny 
faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under 
sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in 
the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming 
horde. 

 But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past atruggling prosoners, 
and into he Great Hall. 

 Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting al 
within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, 
and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced 
their way inside. 

 Harry saw Yaxley slammed tot he floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov 
fall with a scream at Flitwick's hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by 
Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and 


Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback. Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and 
Percy flooting Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, 
not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son. 

 Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, Kingsley all at once, and 
there was a cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish 
him - 

 Bellatrix was still fighing too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her 
master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny and Luna, all battling their hardest, but 
Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry's attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so 
close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch - 

 He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had 
gone a few steps he was knocked sideways. 

 "NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!" 

 Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms, Bellatrix spun on 
the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger. 

 "OUT OF MY WAY!" shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a simple 
swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly 
Weasley's wand slashed and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered and became 
a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the withces' feet became bot 
and cracked; both woman were fighting to kill. 

 "No!" Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. 
"Get back! Get back! She is mine!" 

 Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and 
his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, 
wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent. 

 "What will happen to your children when I've killed you?" taunted Bellatrix, as 
mad as her master, capering as Molly's curses danced around her. "When Mummy's gone 
the same way as Freddie?" 

 "You - will - never - touch - our - children - again!" screamed Mrs. Weasley. 

 Bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he 
toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen 
before it did. 

 Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's constreched arm and hit her squarely in 
the chest, directly over her heart. 

 Bellatrix's glounting smile froze, her eyes seemd to bulge: For the tiniest space of 
time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, 
and Voldemord screamed. 

 Harry felt as though he turned into slow motin: he saw McGonagall, Kingsley and 
Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at 
the fall of his last, best leutenant exploded with the force of a bomb, Voldemort raised his 
wand and directed it at Molly Weasley. 

 "Protego!" roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the 
Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility 
Cloak at last. 

 The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of :"Harry!" "HE'S 
ALIVE!" were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and 


completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, 
to circle each other. 

 "I don't want anyone else to help," Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his 
voice carried like a trumpet call. "It's got to be like this. It's got to be me." 

 Voldemort hissed. 

 "Potter doesn't mean that," he said, his red eyes wide. "This isn't how he works, is 
it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?" 

 "Nobody," said Harry simply. "There are no more Horcruxes. It's just you and me. 
Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good. . . ." 

 "One of us?" jeered Voldemort, and his wholy body was taut and his red eyes 
stared, a snake that was about to strike. "You think it will be you, do you, the boy who 
has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?" 

 "Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?" asked Harry. They were 
still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance 
from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort's. "Accident, when I 
decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn't defend myself tonight, and still 
survived, and returned to fight again?" 

 "Accidents!" screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching 
crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to 
breathe but they two. "Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled 
behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!" 

 "You won't be killing anyone else tonight," said Harry as they circled, and stared 
into each other's eyes, green into red. "You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. 
Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people - " 

 "But you did not!" 

 " - I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're 
protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are 
binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your 
mistakes, Riddle, do you?" 

 "You dare -" 

 "Yes, I dare," said Harry. "I know things you don't know, Tom Riddle. I know 
lots of important things that you don't. Want to hear some, before you make another big 
mistake?" 

 Voldemort did not speak, but powled in a circle, and Harry knew that he kept him 
temporarily mesmerized at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that Harry might 
indeed know a final secret. . . . 

 "Is it love again?" said Voldemort, his snake's face jeering. "Dumbledore favorite 
solution, love, which he claimed conqered death, though love did not stop him falling 
from the tower and breaking like and old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me 
stamping out your Modblood mother like a cockroack, Potter - and nobody seems to love 
you enough to run forward this time and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now 
when I strike?" 

 "Just one thing," said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each 
other, held apart by nothing but the last secret. 

 "If it is not love that will save you this time," said Voldemort, "you must believe 
that you have magic that i do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?" 


 "I believe both," said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face, 
though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more 
frightening than his screams; humorles and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall. 

 "You think you know more magic than I do?" he said. "Than I, than Lord 
Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?" 

 "Oh he dreamed of it," said Harry, "but he knew more than you, knew enough not 
to do what you've done." 

 "You mean he was weak!" screamed Voldemort. "Too weak to dare, too weak to 
take what might have been his, what will be mine!" 

 "No, he was cleverer than you," said Harry, "a better wizard, a better man." 

 "I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!" 

 "You thought you did," said Harry, "but you were wrong." 

 For the frist time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the 
walls drew breath as one. 

 "Dumbledore is dead!" Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as in the marble 
tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he will not return!" 

 "Yes, Dumbledore is dead," said Harry calmly, "but you didn't have him killed. 
He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole 
thing with the man you thought was your servant." 

 "What chldish dream is this?" said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his 
red eyes did not waver from Harry's. 

 "Severus Snape wasn't yours," said Harry. "Snape was Dumbledore's. 
Dumbledore's from the moment you starting hunting down my mother. And you never 
realized it, because of the thing you can't understand. You never saw Snape cast a 
Patronus, did you, Riddle?" 

 Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about 
to tear each other apart. 

 "Snape's Patronus was a doe," said Harry, "the same as my mother's, because he 
loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should 
have realized," he said as he saw Voldemort's nostrils flare, "he asked you to spare her 
life, didn't he?" 
"He desired her, that was all," sneered Voldemort, "but when she had gone, he 
agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worhier of him - " 

 "Of course he told you that," said Harry, "but he was Dumbledore's spy from the 
moment you threatened her, and he's been working against you ever since! Dumbledore 
was already dying when Snape finished him!" 

 "It matters not!" shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt 
attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. "It matters not whether Snape was 
mine or Dumbledore's, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed 
them as I crushed your mother, Snape's supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, 
Potter, and in ways that you do not understand! 

 "Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that 
Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy - I 
reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you 
caught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, 
the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! Dumbledore's last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!" 


 "Yeah, it did." said Harry. "You're right. But before you try to kill me, I'd advise 
you think what you've done . . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . ." 

 "What is this?" 

 Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, 
nothing had socked Voldemort like this. Harry saw is pupils contract to thin slits, saw the 
skin around his eyes whiten. 

 "It's your one last chance," said Harry, "it's all you've got left. . . . I've seen what 
you'll be otherwise. . . . Be a man. . . try. . . Try for some remorse. . . ." 

 You dare --- ? said Voldemort again. 

 Yes, I dare, said Harry, because Dumbledores last plan hasnt backfired on 
me at all. Its backfired on you, Riddle. 

 Voldemorts hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped Dracos 
very tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds away. 

 That wand still isnt working properly for you because you murdered the wrong 
person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated 
Dumbledore. 

 He killed ---  

 Arent you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledores death was 
planned between them! Dumbledore instended to die, undefeated, the wands last true 
master! If all had gone as planned, the wands power would have died with him, because 
it had never been won from him! 

 But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand! Voldemorts voice 
shook with malicious pleasure. I stole the wand from its last masters tomb! I removed it 
against the last masters wishes! Its power is mine! 

 You still dont get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isnt enough! Holding 
it, using it, doesnt make it really yours. Didnt you listen to Ollivander? The wand 
chooses the wizard . . . The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore 
died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from 
Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the 
worlds most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance . . . 

 Voldemorts chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, 
feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face. 

 The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy. 

 Blank shock showed in Voldemorts face for a moment, but then it was gone. 

 But what does it matter? he said softly. Even if you are right, Potter, it makes 
no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel on skill 
alone . . . and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy . . . 

 But youre too late, said Harry. Youve missed your chance. I got there first. I 
overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took his wand from him. 

 Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall 
upon it. 

 So it all comes down to this, doesnt it? whispered Harry. Does the wand in 
your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master 
of the Elder Wand. 

 A red-glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of 
dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces 


at the same time, so that Voldemorts was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high 
voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Dracos wand: 

 Avada Kedavra! 

 Expelliarmus! 

 The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between 
them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the 
spells collided. Harry saw Voldemorts green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand 
fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of 
Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to 
take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught 
the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the 
scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body 
feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. 
Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two 
wands in his hand, staring down at his enemys shell. 

 One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended: and then the 
tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers 
rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and 
the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped 
around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. The Ginny, Neville, and 
Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall 
and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, not 
tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds 
of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it 
was over at last --- 

 The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. 
Harry was an indispensible part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, 
of grief and celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their 
savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few 
of them, seemed to occur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, 
witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter 
as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to 
themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of 
Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had 
been named temporary Minister of Magic. 

 They moved Voldemorts body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away form 
the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting 
him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, not nobody was sitting according to 
House anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, 
centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in the corner, and Grawp peered in 
through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. 
After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna. 

 Id want some peace and quiet, if it were me, she said. 

 Id love some, he replied. 

 Ill distract them all, she said. Use your cloak. 

 And before he could say a word, she had cried, Oooh, look, a Blibbering 


Humdinger! and pointed out the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and 
Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet. 

 Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two 
tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mothers shoulder: There would be time 
to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword 
of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. 
Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled 
together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was 
paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked, he saw families reunited, and finally, 
he saw the two whose company he craved most. 

 Its me, he muttered, crouching down between them. Will you come with 
me? 

They stood up at once, and together he, Ron and Hermione left the Great Hall. 
Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and 
rubble and bloodstains occurred ever few steps as their climbed. 

 Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the 
corridors singing a victory song of his own composition: 

 

We did it, we bashed them, wee Potters the one, 

And Voldys gone moldy, so now lets have fun! 

 

 Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesnt it? said 
Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through. 

 Happiness would come, Harry though, but at the moment it was muffled by 
exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical 
wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to 
sleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for 
so long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seem in the 
Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all 
their shock and amazement, when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been 
walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination. 

 Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmasters 
study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry 
wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore. 

 Can we go up? he asked the gargoyle. 

 Feel free, groaned the statue. 

 They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly 
upward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top. 

 He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, 
and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death 
Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort --- 

 But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of 
Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases 
their wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each others hands; they danced up 
and down on their chairs in which they have been painted: Dilys Derwent sobbed 
unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Niggelus called, 


in his high, reedy voice, And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our 
contribution not be forgotten! 

 But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly 
behind the headmasters chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half-moon 
spectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him 
filled Harry wit h the same balm as phoenix song. 

 At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming 
and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at 
Dumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed 
though he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice. 

 The thing that was hidden in the Snitch, he began, I dropped it in the forest. I 
dont exactly here, but Im not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree? 

 My dear boy, I do, said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused 
and curious. A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of 
you. Does anyone know else know where it fell? 

 No one, said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction. 

 Im going to keep Ignotuss present, though, said Harry, and Dumbledore 
beamed. 

 But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on! 

 And then theres this. 

 Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a 
reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see. 

 I dont want it. said Harry. 

 What? said Ron loudly. Are you mental? 

 I know its powerful, said Harry wearily. But I was happier with mine. So . . . 

 He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves 
of holly tstill just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather. Hermione had said 
that they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if 
this did not work, nothing would. 

 He laid the broken wand upon the headmasters desk, touched it with the very tip 
of the Elder Wand, and said, Reparo. 

 As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had 
succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his 
fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion. 

 Im putting the Elder Wand, he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with 
enormous affection and admiration, back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a 
natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, wont it? The previous master will 
never have been defeated. Thatll be the end of it. 

 Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other. 

 Are you sure? said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as 
he looked at the Elder Wand. 

 I think Harrys right, said Hermione quietly. 

 That wands more trouble than its worth. said Harry. And quite honestly, he 
turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying 
waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a 
sandwich there, Ive had enough trouble for a lifetime. 


 

Epilogue 

Nineteen Years Later 

 

 

Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was 
crisp as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the 
great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like 
cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages tattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents 
were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed 
fearfully behind here brothers, clutching her father's arm. 

 "It won't be long, and you'll be going too," Harry told her. 

 "Two years," sniffed Lily. "I want to go now!" 

 The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the 
barrier between platforms nine and ten, Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the 
surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. 

 "I won't! I won't be a Slytherin!" 

 "James, give it a rest!" said Ginny. 

 "I only said he might be," said James, grinning at his younger brother. "There's 
nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slytherin" 

 But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the 
barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took 
the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. 

 "You'll write to me, won't you?" Albus asked his parents immediately, 
capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother. 

 "Every day, of you want us to," said Ginny. 

 "Not every day," said Albus quickly, "James says most people only get letters 
from home about once a month." 

 "We wrote to James three times a week last year," said Ginny. 

 "And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts," Harry 
put in. "He likes a laugh, your brother." 

 Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they 
reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged 
onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was 
pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the 
mist, into which James had already disappeared. 

 "Where are they?" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed 
as they made their way down the platform. 

 "We'll find them," said Ginny reassuringly. 

 But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. 
Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud, Harry thought he head 
Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not 
to stop and say hello. . . . 

 "I think that's them, Al," said Ginny suddenly. 


 A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last 
carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn 
right up to them. 

 "Hi," said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. 

 Roses, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him. 

 "Parked all right, then?" Ron asked Harry. "I did. Hermione didn't believe I could 
pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confound the examiner." 

 "No, I didn't," said Hermione, "I had complete faith in you." 

 "As a matter of fact, I did Confund him," Ron whispered to Harry, as together 
they lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. "I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, 
and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that." 

 Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having 
an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally 
went to Hogwarts. 

 "If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you," said Ron, "but no pressure." 

 "Ron!" 

 Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. 

 "He doesn't mean it," said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying 
attention. Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The 
steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the 
shifting mist. 

 "Look who it is." 

 Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up 
to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The 
new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of 
Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. 

 "So that's little Scorpius," said Ron under his breath. "Make sure you beat him in 
every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains." 

 "Ron, for heaven's sake," said Hermione, half stern, half amused. "Don't try to 
turn them against each other before they've even started school!" 

 "You're right, sorry," said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, "Don't get 
too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you 
married a pureblood." 

 "Hey!" 

 James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and 
was evidently bursting with news. 

 "Teddy's back there," he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into 
the billowing clouds of steam. "Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging 
Victoire!" 

 He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. 

 "Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked teddy 
what he was doing --" 

 "You interrupted them?" said Ginny. "You are so like Ron --" 

 "-- and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's 
snogging her!" James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. 


 "Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!" whispered Lily ecstatically. "Teddy 
would really be part of the family then!" 

 "He already comes round for dinner about four times a week," said Harry "Why 
don't we just invite him to live with is and have done with it?" 

 "Yeah!" said James enthusiastically. "I don't mind sharing with Al--Teddy could 
have my room!" 

 "No," said Harry firmly, "you and Al will share a room only when I want the 
house demolished." 

 He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's. 

 "It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board." 

 "Don't forget to give Neville our love!" Ginny told James as she hugged him. 

 "Mum! I can't give a professor love!" 

 "But you know Neville--" 

 James rolled his eyes. 

 "Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into 
Herbology and give him love. . . ." 

 Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a 
kick at Albus. 

 "See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals." 

 "I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!" 

 but James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a 
fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint 
away up the corridor to find his friends. 

 "Thestrals are nothing to worry about," Harry told Albus. "They're gentle things, 
there's nothing scare about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the 
carriages, you'll be going in the boats." 

 Ginny kissed Albus good-bye. 

 "See you at Christmas." 

 "Bye, Al," said Harry as his son hugged him. "Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to 
tea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you're learned how. And 
don't let James wind you up." 

 "What if I'm in Slytherin?" 

 The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of 
departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. 

 Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of 
Harry's three children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes. 

 "Ablus Severus," Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she 
was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose, who was now on the train, "you were 
named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was 
probably the bravest man I ever knew." 

 "But just say--" 

 "--then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't 
matter to us, Al. But if it matter to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. 
The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account." 

 "Really?" 

 "It did for me," said Harry. 


 He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in 
Albus's face when he said it. But how the doorsr were slamming all along the scarlet train, 
and the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute 
reminders, Albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him. 
Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on 
the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry. 

 "Why are they all staring?" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look 
at the other students. 

 "Don't let it worry you," said Ron. "It's me, I'm extremely famous." 

 Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to more, and Harry walked 
alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept 
smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide 
away from him. . . . 

 The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. 
Harry's hand was still raised in farewell. 

 "He'll be alright," murmured Ginny. 

 As Harry looked dat her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the 
lightning scar on his forehead. 

 "I know he will." 

 The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.
